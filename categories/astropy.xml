These were introduced in PEP 484.
In this regards, static type checking is the most impo &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://adl1995.github.io/type-annotations-in-python-36-and-using-mypy-as-a-static-type-checker.html"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Astropy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170611_0758_adl1995/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 06:58:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting Through GSoC (I guess so)</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170610_2208_haikyu/</link><dc:creator>aaryapatil</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;There are two types of people in this world.

Of course, this is in context of astronomical data.

RA / DEC
RA (right ascension) and DEC (declination) are the longitudes and latitudes of the sky. RA corresponds to east/west direction (like longitude), while Dec measures north/south dire &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://adl1995.github.io/an-introduction-to-coordinate-systems-used-in-astronomy.html"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Astropy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/05/20170523_0737_adl1995/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 06:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How I got into GSoC-2017, the “smaller” things that made it possible</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/05/20170510_1112_ayadav/</link><dc:creator>Ayush Yadav</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;It was late February, and like any year, semester in college was going just as chill as it could.
