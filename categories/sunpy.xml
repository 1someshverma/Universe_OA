OpenAstronomy has helped me improve the way I express myself in a satirical manner. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what’s the plan for my future but let’s save that story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y0Rim-lsXAAtQbRuk6-37A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Here’s picture of sun and its field lines to show that I’m working on astronomy related, but actually have no proper knowledge of how any of this works, cheers! 🍻&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit of how my last week of “officially” working on Sunkit-Pyvista went :-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We put a pin on the animator as it didn’t make sense for us to work on something that isn’t of more value for the first release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pfsspy field lines now allow for a custom color function to be passed while plotting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All main functionality is big-free (as far as I know) and can be used efficiently without having to worry about something failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final boss with our little project is trying to get the documentation to render 3D plots correctly and this is being handled by the mentors which is a huge load off my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it I guess, these last few PRs mark the end of the so called “GSoC” period. What more have I left out? I’ve spoken about everything there is to be said, we’re nearing the end of this pretty interesting journey that I had embarked on. Other than a small bit of sadness, I’ve got nothing else to say. I’ve decided to continue working on Sunkit-Pyvista as being an open-sourced contributor is all about the community and I’m doing my part in working towards that (It’s not like I was planning on leaving either way though, this is almost a part of my daily routine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to Sunpy and the best mentors I’ve interacted with. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=e9ce2f5de6dc" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210816_0320_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 02:20:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>About my Google Summer of Code Project: Part 3</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210801_1853_adwaitbhope/</link><dc:creator>Adwait Bhope</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I celebrate the merging of the PR that brings reproject to NDCube! It defines a base-level functionality or MVP if you want to call it that, along with some relevant documentation. We also mark the release of ndcube’s 2.0 RC1. This is an important milestone since ndcube 2.0 brings significant changes, owing to the implementation of the new high-level WCS API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next plan of action was to extend the method to use other algorithms that reproject supports. Interpolation (the one that the above PR implements) supports multi-dimensional cubes but “adaptive” and “exact” algorithms do not. For the time being, they only work on 2D cubes containing celestial axes. So that’s what I’ve implemented them for in a new PR, which is currently under review and should hopefully get merged soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem for this PR was identifying celestial axes. We’ve taken a shortcut to solve this quickly and avoid creating a blocker, but a better implementation is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NDCubeSequence PR that I talked about in the last blog post hit a few unexpected edge cases which are under work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re nearing the end of GSoC’s official timeline and while that is saddening, the good thing is that open source doesn’t need a GSoC timeline for contributing. I do hope that I’ll be able to tie up any loose ends before the end date, but I suppose that does not matter in the community’s bigger picture. Functional additions, bug fixes, and performance improvements are always going to be coming in for reproject, and I plan to maintain at least that bit of code (or more) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=f6354389b27f" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210801_1853_adwaitbhope/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 17:53:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Balance</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210730_1925_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*6vTTZ8HC33kEpYk0Wr8gxg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Cosmic Balance” — completely unrelated type of balance to what I go on to talk to talk about in this post. Although, outer space looks all fancy and it goes well with the theme of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From all my previous posts, it is quite evident that I obsess over small and insignificant details, mainly directed towards how my life is going to be in the future and this entire concept of “happiness”. However, the past few months of working with Sunpy has brought about this odd sense of calm. The entire feeling of stress being an emotion goes out the window. Maybe this is what doing something you love, maybe it’s the people — or maybe it’s just extremely good timing combined with coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I suppose these questions don’t have simple answers. Regardless, whatever I’m doing with right now has restored that balance that I was longing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to what has been happening with sunkit-pyvista. To summarize, I spent an entire week fixing things that I caused due to over-confidence :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I think I’m nearing the end of this project. A few bits of functionality has to be added in but for the most part, I think it’s all in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saving and loading entire scenes are now possible with the work that we’ve done. This took quite a bit of time and it was pretty interesting to see how we could extend functionality to such massive extents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We uncovered a few hidden issues that may have occurred because of me. Ones such as ill-defined tests because I may have been slightly over-confident with how I write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a bit of time was spent resolving these issues, but I can definitely conclude that it was well worth the effort and I certainly learnt my lesson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure tests are now a thing, we drew some parallels with Pyvista’s code and structured our own figure testing methodology which makes it easier for us to visually identify any mishaps in our plots. After all, we’re creating a library for data visualization. It’d be sad if our code tests pass and we’re under the assumption that everything is working fine (yet another dig at myself for not writing efficient tests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can safely say that Sunkit-Pyvista is quite balanced and usable now, or at least I hope so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to how this might be the last few PRs of this project under the whole “GSoC timeline”, this makes me both sad and happy. It’s saddening to see that something I worked towards for over 6 months has kind of come to an end. Happy because I’ve gotten to work with some of the best developers and I genuinely enjoyed every bit of it. This offsets the balance in my life, but I think we may have a solution to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=239840d26318" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210730_1925_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:25:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>So here I am, a month into the coding period and at the onset of the first evaluation.</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210711_1548_adwaitbhope/</link><dc:creator>Adwait Bhope</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;About my Google Summer of Code Project: Part 2&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I am, a month into the coding period and at the onset of the first evaluation. I talked about what my project was in the &lt;a href="https://adwaitbhope.medium.com/about-my-google-summer-of-code-project-part-1-b56e7277046e"&gt;last blog&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll use this one to cover the progress we’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work so far has been compiled into 3 messy PRs. To start with, reprojecting an NDCube onto another WCS requires that you first validate whether the source and target WCS transformations are in fact compatible. It’s no good if they represent an entirely different coordinate system. They need to have the same number of world axes and in the same order. The first PR introduces a function to check this and it has been merged into the main branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one implements the actual reproject method on NDCube, leveraging the reproject package. Currently, it serves as a wrapper around the interpolation algorithm, with plans to support more algorithms soon. But that bit is dependent on optimizing the current functionality by being a little smarter about detecting axes that do not need to be modified. This would also help speed up the function AND use less memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third PR is an interesting one. There is a class called NDCubeSequence, which is, as the name says, a sequence of NDCubes. Think of it as multiple NDCubes arranged in an array with some additional convenient functionality. Let’s say you have some information about an image that isn’t really related to any of the axes but applies to the whole image — the timestamp of the image, for example. If you have multiple similar images taken at different timestamps, they can form an NDCubeSequence, where the sequence axis represents time. You can also combine the sequence axis with an existing axis of the cubes so that they form a large panorama or mosaic, which is wider than the field of view that could’ve been captured in one image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the individual cubes do not share the same WCS object even if they are images of the same entity. This is because of effects like wobble or rotation that introduce slight changes in the WCS. So we used the previously implemented reproject method to get all the cubes on the same grid, so they can share the WCS. Then, we stacked the data of all cubes together in one single numpy array, introducing an extra dimension that corresponds to the sequence. A new WCS is also constructed that includes this newly formed dimension. You combine this data and the WCS, and voila, you have reduced the NDCubeSequence to an NDCube!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps would be to refine this behaviour and try to optimize wherever possible. Then we’ll try to get these 2 remaining PRs merged in the main branch to avoid getting inundated later. So, this is all for this post, see you in the next one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=2e6f76a45653" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210711_1548_adwaitbhope/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 14:48:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Not just Python.</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210710_1254_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Not just Python&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunkit-Pyvista is doing quite well as of today, this goes without saying due to the fact the the Sunpy developers put in quite a bit of effort into reading all the stuff that I write and they do carefully review them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve personally faced no a few issues with getting things to work as they are. I don’t have much to say about this project except the fact that I’m super stoked about it and it has been going super well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to write code from scratch that’s turned into an actual project that would help someone, I also get to learn stuff that I never saw myself doing. From tinkering around with CircleCI to getting documentation to work the way we want them to, this project seems like the ideal one for a python developer like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize what happened over the past few weeks —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve gotten over most of the project and we’re now working towards the initial stuff we put a pin in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic plotting functionality of Sunpy now exists with Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We moved the documentation over to GitHub workflows and I’m hoping that we get it to work by the end of the month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve introduced animations as a new feature to our work and we’ve got some ideas with how to take this forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having no prior experience with Astrophysics, I decided to give Stephen Hawking’s “The Theory of Everything” a read. (Well, not a read, I prefer listening to audio books even though they are inferior). Revisiting physics with an astronomical sense gave me such a new perspective on what I am doing and fueled the motivation to continue the project with the same excitement I began with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zrsJJIzLw4FexpUa1-SAUw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regardless of it not actually looking like this — it still is fascinating, isn’t it?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I never saw myself voluntarily taking an interest in astrophysics or open source software, but here I am today, doing both of them simultaneously. Who knows what the future holds for me, I’ve always been anxious about that. At times like these I try to think of how this universe is so nondeterministic, we may have a few guesses and theories as to why things happen the way it does but, we can’t say for sure. This thought grounds my thoughts and I suddenly stop worrying about everything, for sometime at-least…&lt;/p&gt;

From where we started of with Sunkit-Pyvista, to where we are today makes me feel a tad bit happy! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/985/1*-X2tw67TTrMoj3F43QS0uA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks 1 and 2 were initially set out for me to complete adding rotation functionality to the library, which started off great, but ended up causing some confusion 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was quickly sorted out and we went with not having to implement rotation functionality and moved on, learning that not everything will go according to plan and it’s okay for stuff to not work out at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the work that I had set out to do was completed well and it was all smooth sailing from then on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We worked on implementing the setting of the initial camera position from Astropy’s Skycoord.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few 2D methods were converted to it’s 3D counter part to be used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit tests for the implemented methods were added as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/225/0*alo7nZjT7uTO6BzJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mid-level solar flare, observed on Jan. 12, 2015.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m don’t know the first thing when it comes to astrophysics or astronomy, I do know that there is some pretty cool stuff going on out there though! I may not know what that is, but there’s a small sense of satisfaction in knowing that maybe whatever I’m doing is going to help someone out there do their work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=1c9683c38461" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210622_0048_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 23:48:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>About my Google Summer of Code Project: Part 1</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210621_1658_adwaitbhope/</link><dc:creator>Adwait Bhope</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been eyeing Google Summer of Code last year (and the year before that), but never really got around to doing anything about it. It’s a wonderful learning experience and being in my final year of college this was the last opportunity I was going to get. So I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started late, sometime during late February. I picked out a few organizations that looked interesting to me. &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;openastronomy&lt;/a&gt; particularly caught my eye because I was working on another project of mine related to Astronomy. In fact we were using one of the Python libraries under openastronomy. Now this is an umbrella organization, which means that there are multiple sub-organizations — sunpy, astropy, radis, poliastro, and a few more. They’re used extensively by the scientific community in their research. The project I selected was under sunpy, which is a Python library for solar data analysis. The project is about resampling data to increase or decrease its resolution — more on that later. Again, I had recently performed this operation in one of my projects, so it seemed only natural for me to go with this one. I worked on some issues on GitHub and submitted PRs, tried to get a hold of the codebase, put together a proposal, got feedback from the project mentors and friends, and submitted it. After about a month of impatient waiting, I received an email saying that my proposal was accepted! Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I plan to continue writing these blogs throughout the project and since this is the first one, let me take a moment to talk about the project. So, there’s a sunpy-affiliated package called ndcube, which exists to provide users an easier way of handling coordinates. Astronomical data like images taken from cameras are usually stored as n-dimensional arrays. A dimension could represent spatial or temporal axes. In such an array, the pixel coordinates map to some coordinates in the real world. These could be RA and Dec, or in the case of solar data, Helioprojective Latitude and Longitude. Nevertheless, there needs to be a mapping from the pixels to the real world. This is given by the World Coordinate System, which is just a set of (complicated) mathematical transformations. ndcube is a package that correlates the actual data with its transformations in such a way that you can manipulate the data, and the transformations will continue to remain consistent. It can be used with any type of data like images, spectra, timeseries data, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MHKTGHeR4F3nHd2gO1ocUw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Open Astronomy and SunPy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, researchers like to upsample or downsample the resolution of their data, perhaps to improve the Signal to Noise Ratio or even just to get their data onto the same grid. My project under Google Summer of Code is exactly this — to implement this functionality under ndcube. Luckily, there exists a package called reproject that has a few algorithms implemented already. My job would be to expose this through a succinct API under ndcube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my mentors and I have broken down this work and set smaller and more achievable targets to begin with, and I’ve started working on them. Unfortunately, my Community Bonding Period was quite stagnant thanks to my college commitments, but now that they’re out of the way, I have more time on my hands to devote to the project. I’ll be publishing more blogs about my progress in the coming weeks, hopefully more frequently. Talk to you in the next one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=b56e7277046e" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210621_1658_adwaitbhope/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:58:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Summer with SunPy ☀️</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210603_0834_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was introduced to the world of open source by a few peers of mine and despite having the many unanswered questions about why open source software exists, eventually I decided to try my hand at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I had mentioned how I’d continue to be a contributor to SunPy regardless of the outcome of GSOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I made a promise to myself that regardless of the outcome of my proposal, I will continue to contribute to this organization that taught me so much.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, this showed up a couple of weeks later :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*WnrYxkGo8nkbdKoDz-xCAA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out things went my way and this gave me the motivation I was lacking for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my project is quite simple actually. &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt; allows for visualization of spatially-aware data by means of Map objects. These objects have extensive 2D visualization capabilities for plotting various coordinate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibility will be experimenting and tinkering around with these visualization capabilities and converting them into 3D with some extra added functionality! Seems pretty cool right? Well, it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’d be doing :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/191/1*QlX4LmZXc7e_C96fL-qHRA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Converting this&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/917/1*Omv0aIRFxR7VR9F6ruIBaQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To this!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project involves using &lt;strong&gt;Pyvista&lt;/strong&gt;, a python api for using the Visualization Toolkit. The entire project is part of a separate package affiliated with SunPy and you can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first 2 weeks with SunPy went great! It involved learning and tinkering around with &lt;strong&gt;Sphinx &lt;/strong&gt;for documentation which I had never used before, figuring out what goes where and how it happens was pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve finally decided on how we’d go about producing unit tests for these plots, we uncovered an issue with &lt;strong&gt;PyVista &lt;/strong&gt;as well. The project mentors and I had a few discussions on how to render these 3D plots for display in our documentation, how this would impact the continuous integration builds as our current one seemed to be having a few issues with &lt;strong&gt;XVFB&lt;/strong&gt; server and displaying the plots correctly. These issues are yet to be fixed and a concrete solution is to be decided on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few pull requests with the initial code to set up the package and provide basic plotting functionality was merged in and the package finally produces a 3D plot for any map in &lt;strong&gt;Sunpy&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked the end of the community bonding phase of the project and in the coming weeks, I’ll be working on experimenting with rotation and &lt;strong&gt;AstroPy’s SkyCoord&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll also be working on some plotting field lines from &lt;strong&gt;PfssPy&lt;/strong&gt; which would add some extra functionality to the library. I’ve finally gotten into getting my hands dirty with the code and I’m loving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much it for the first fortnight with &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;, looking forward to see how this project turns out, everything seems to be going well and I’m grateful to be working on this project with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

Over rock and under tree,&lt;br&gt;
By caves where never sun has shone,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
By streams that never find the sea;&lt;br&gt;
Over snow by winter sown,&lt;br&gt;
And through the merry flowers of June,&lt;br&gt;
Over grass and over stone,&lt;br&gt;
And under mountains in the moon.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;~ The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first read the Hobbit, I always wondered what going on an adventure would feel like.&lt;br&gt;
Would I be fighting goblins, striding through enchanted forests with wizards?&lt;br&gt;
Would there be a treasure? Would there be a Dragon? &lt;br&gt;
And as I grew older, would or could there be a happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, an adventure it indeed was.&lt;br&gt;
Building a domain specific Deep Learning Toolkit, learning about packaging, testing, and the best practices, all to just set the package up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did fight goblins that were the bugs in my PyTorch pipelines. Those NaNs, oh those pesky NaNs! They really were like goblins that popped up in the input data when I least expected them.&lt;br&gt;
Though I did enlist the help of my wizard mentors, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dpshelio"&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/drsophiemurray"&gt;Sophie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mbobra"&gt;Monica,&lt;/a&gt; and together we marched through the enchanted (or were they cursed?) forests of SWPC and HEK to get the data we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fascinating experience. One that I will cherish forever.&lt;br&gt;
I wish I could extend this summer, but my time is up, and all our goals for this project have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, all adventures must come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Road goes ever on and on &lt;br&gt;
Out from the door where it began.&lt;br&gt;
Now far ahead the Road has gone,&lt;br&gt;
Let others follow it who can!&lt;br&gt;
Let them a journey new begin,&lt;br&gt;
But I at last with weary feet&lt;br&gt;
Will turn towards the lighted inn,&lt;br&gt;
My evening-rest and sleep to meet”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we come to the end of my GSoC journey, let’s talk about the treasure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Treasure&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;1 ) The Search Events Object&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often we find data representing the same observed physical phenomenon to have slightly different values when the data comes from different sources.&lt;br&gt;
This could be due to noise or different choices of parameters for the preprocessing techniques employed.&lt;br&gt;
This creates problems when the two datasets need to be compared, and /or may data exclusive to them.&lt;br&gt;
We faced this problem when the data from NOAA that characterizes the Active Regions was not available in the Sunspotter dataset.&lt;br&gt;
Although the observations were identical, they were not exact. &lt;br&gt;
Their multidimensional nature also prevented matching by simple sorting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my repository, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Raahul-Singh/pythia"&gt;Pythia,&lt;/a&gt; we created a general Search Events Table Matching algorithm that would solve this problem.&lt;br&gt;
Although it is general enough to be used with any tabular dataset, we do plan on making it more ‘intelligent’ so as to require minimal preprocessing from the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) The Flare Forecasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;After significant preprocessing, we were able to get a good enough dataset to feed to our deep learning pipeline. &lt;br&gt;
We wanted to predict if an Active Region would flare in the first six hours from its observation or not.&lt;br&gt;
We were inspired by architectures, popular in academia in the domain of flare forecasting, Though our approach was the first to combine modern Deep Learning techniques for building our Convolutional Nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some PyTorch magic, we were able to get a prediction accuracy of around 84% on the test set in the binary classification of whether an active region would flare or not. A study of flare forecasting using Machine learning in a fixed time frame from observation is unique in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented an Autoencoder to get a low dimensional representation of the Active Regions, so that they may be used with other scalar measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also were curious to see if the absolute orientation of the Active regions with respect to the sun was of any significance in the Active Region’s flaring activity.&lt;br&gt;
While we were expecting a connection, we were surprised to see that the orientation mattered more in the case where the Active Region did flare than in the case where it did not. More work is required before we can quantitatively state our findings on this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://github.com/Raahul-Singh/pythia"&gt;Pythia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a project to analyze the Sunspotter dataset, has grown way beyond its original scope.&lt;br&gt;
With the power of Pytorch Lightning and SunPy, Pythia is shaping out be a general-purpose Deep learning Toolkit for Solar Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barrier to entry for using Deep Learning in Solar Physics Research is quite high for people without the technical knowledge of Deep Learning and without the time to invest heavily into learning the many nuances of modern Deep Learning frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Pythia, we plan on providing a SciKit Learn like interface, with the power and muscle of PyTorch and the elegance and order of Pytorch Lightning.&lt;br&gt;
Although the expansion and generalization are still underway, with more use cases and help from the community, Pythia will surely help in making modern Deep Learning more accessible to the Solar Physics community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Dragon&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Roads go ever ever on&lt;br&gt;
Under cloud and under star,&lt;br&gt;
Yet feet that wandering have gone&lt;br&gt;
Turn at last to home afar.&lt;br&gt;
Eyes that fire and sword have seen&lt;br&gt;
And horror in the halls of stone&lt;br&gt;
Look at last on meadows green&lt;br&gt;
And trees and hills they long have known.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Bilbo, my Dragon isn’t evil like Smaug. &lt;br&gt;
It isn’t greedy of gold, nor too large or too scary.&lt;br&gt;
It tells me it prefers gardening over desolating lands as a hobby. &lt;br&gt;
And has so far been fairly consistent in his participation in our friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little secret that not many know is that my dragon doesn’t have a physical existence.&lt;br&gt;
I confide in my reader and trust them to keep this secret, a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragon I am talking about, of course, is this newfound sense of spirit and the freedom that I have acquired over this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer has been magical for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, I worked on what I would call a dream project, using AI in Natural Sciences.&lt;br&gt;
I interacted with scientists from NASA, UCL, Trinity, etc., all of whom are heroes to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I co-founded an Open Source organization, &lt;a href="https://github.com/wildfirepy"&gt;The WildfirePy Project,&lt;/a&gt; for doing my part in studying, understanding, and preventing wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I got my first job! Becoming financially independent, and working on projects that make a difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in my wildest dreams, I never imagined such fortune and serendipity.&lt;br&gt;
In all honesty, I’m not sure if the Dragon will stay, or fly away.&lt;br&gt;
I am yet to start counting on it for its company when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hope it stays. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSoC and Open Source in general, have been life-changing for me.&lt;br&gt;
More than anything, it has given me a way to express myself, my love for science, my love for code and my desire to be part of something bigger than myself.&lt;br&gt;
And act on it.&lt;br&gt;
Open source is nourishment to my soul, and I shall forever be grateful to Google Summer of Code for helping me get started with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to SunPy for making my life more luminous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Ending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Road goes ever on and on&lt;br&gt;
Down from the door where it began.&lt;br&gt;
Now far ahead the Road has gone,&lt;br&gt;
And I must follow, if I can,&lt;br&gt;
Pursuing it with eager feet,&lt;br&gt;
Until it joins some larger way&lt;br&gt;
Where many paths and errands meet.&lt;br&gt;
And whither then? I cannot say.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Ending? &lt;br&gt;
Well, I wouldn’t know.&lt;br&gt;
I am just getting started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A lot I learned from the community; a lot I contributed to it. What I took back from GSoC is way more than what I put forward for it. So let’s see what I did in the last weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now added a guide on how to Add “Attrs” to the registry in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4387"&gt;PR #4387&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the developer guide for Fido.&lt;br&gt;
I have added tests to check metadata queries in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4385"&gt;#4385&lt;/a&gt; and ways to index the results using the client’s name. It eases to retrieve individual provider responses from a Fido result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
I resolved all reviews so far on PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4419"&gt;#4419&lt;/a&gt;, so now it will ease the merging of &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4321"&gt;PR #4321&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
They await review as of now, maybe merged within this week. In short, almost all the proposed goals were achieved in the project. I experienced a more “pythonic” way of coding. Discovered new heights of the language, learned some solar physics, and what matters most, became part of a great community. Hopefully I made &lt;em&gt;Fido Great Again!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAPRE NOCTEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
