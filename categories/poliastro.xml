Let me tell you something, this is going to be the beginning of our journey together, we are going on to a spatial adventure! Sit tight, and wait for the countdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="countdown" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/falcon-9-crs-12-compressor.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let me introduce myself, my name is María Eugenia, though everybody knows me as &lt;em&gt;Meuge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First things first, SPACE? How did we get here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All began with the big bang, no wait, that's a story for another time. All began in 2019, when &lt;strong&gt;JuanLu&lt;/strong&gt; reached out to the &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of&lt;/em&gt;  ~~the ring~~  &lt;em&gt;Python Científico&lt;/em&gt; community to informed us that &lt;strong&gt;Poliastro&lt;/strong&gt; would be part of &lt;strong&gt;GSoC 2019&lt;/strong&gt;.
To be honest with you, I had just a slight idea of astrodynamics, so I took a big leap of faith and asked JuanLu where I could make myself useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that JuanLu wasn't that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/05/20200517_1000_meuge/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New features after GSOC19</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190820_2000_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;GSOC 2019 Edition has almost finished.

of course, new issues and bugs appeared.

Unfortunately, it's time
to bid adieu to the summer and have a look on what has been accomplished so far.
The CZML Extractor
This was undoubtedly the main and most time-consuming part of the project. The extractor
allows users to easily conv &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/19/2019-08-19-czml-extractor-an-overview.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190819_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hard reformat week</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190818_1530_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Reformat on poliastro.atmosphere
After implementing the COESA62 and COESA76 models in
#738 I was not completly
happy because of lots of data and coefficients at the beginning of each script.
Therefore and after asking Juanlu, it was finally decided to move all those
numbers to text files under the * &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/18/2019-08-16-hard-reformat-week/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190818_1530_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Atmospheric models and more!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1900_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks for this last period...
While checking the stability of the 0.13, GSOC continues and new bugs,
implementations, and others need to be solved for the 0.14. Most of them are
related to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New frame modeling, implementation, and testing.
New plotting capabilities, such us two attractors in the sam &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/01/2019-08-01-atmospheric-models-and-more/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1900_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ground track plotting and Ellipsoids</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The second evaluation period has come to the end and with the end of the
program drawing ever closer, I'm happy to announce that most work on
the additional deliverables has been complete!
CZML3
I've added polylines and points (along with myriad of other dependent
properties/types). These also mar &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/01/2019-08-01-ground-track-plotting-and-ellipsoids.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New propagators</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190716_0700_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;What are propagators and why do we care about them?
One of the most common problems in astrodynamics and orbital mechanics is that
we want to know where a body will be at a given position along its orbit for a
given time. It is possible to integrate by hard the two-body equation and then
apply some  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/07/16/2019-07-16-new-propagators/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190716_0700_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving forward with the Cesium application</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like in the last couple of weeks I got to work a little in several aspects
of the project. While this didn't allow me to focus on a single feature, it allowed
me to make progress in various different areas.
Bug resolving and 2D mode
First and foremost, I got rid of a particularly frustrating  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/07/15/2019-07-15-moving-forward-with-the-cesium-application/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Converting to CZML and next steps</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So the first phase of GSoC is over and with it, it's time to reflect what
has been achieved in the last couple of months.
CZML3
As I mentioned in the
last blogpost
this is a very useful library created by juanlu. After a
few patches, the library now supports most CZML properties and - as far as I c &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/30/2019-06-30-converting-to-czml-and-next-steps/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting done for next release</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190629_0500_jorgepiloto/</link><dc:creator>Jorge Martínez Garrido</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.13 is getting closer
Version 0.13 is expected to be tagged in about a month. As any other release,
it includes new features such as a new method in the Orbit class called
change_attractor or the trail parameter in StaticOrbitPlotter. However,
this release will also include really important &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/29/2019-06-29-getting-done-for-next-release/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190629_0500_jorgepiloto/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
