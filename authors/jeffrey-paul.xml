&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I had mentioned how I’d continue to be a contributor to SunPy regardless of the outcome of GSOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I made a promise to myself that regardless of the outcome of my proposal, I will continue to contribute to this organization that taught me so much.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, this showed up a couple of weeks later :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*WnrYxkGo8nkbdKoDz-xCAA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out things went my way and this gave me the motivation I was lacking for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my project is quite simple actually. &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt; allows for visualization of spatially-aware data by means of Map objects. These objects have extensive 2D visualization capabilities for plotting various coordinate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibility will be experimenting and tinkering around with these visualization capabilities and converting them into 3D with some extra added functionality! Seems pretty cool right? Well, it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’d be doing :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/191/1*QlX4LmZXc7e_C96fL-qHRA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Converting this&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/917/1*Omv0aIRFxR7VR9F6ruIBaQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To this!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project involves using &lt;strong&gt;Pyvista&lt;/strong&gt;, a python api for using the Visualization Toolkit. The entire project is part of a separate package affiliated with SunPy and you can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first 2 weeks with SunPy went great! It involved learning and tinkering around with &lt;strong&gt;Sphinx &lt;/strong&gt;for documentation which I had never used before, figuring out what goes where and how it happens was pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve finally decided on how we’d go about producing unit tests for these plots, we uncovered an issue with &lt;strong&gt;PyVista &lt;/strong&gt;as well. The project mentors and I had a few discussions on how to render these 3D plots for display in our documentation, how this would impact the continuous integration builds as our current one seemed to be having a few issues with &lt;strong&gt;XVFB&lt;/strong&gt; server and displaying the plots correctly. These issues are yet to be fixed and a concrete solution is to be decided on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few pull requests with the initial code to set up the package and provide basic plotting functionality was merged in and the package finally produces a 3D plot for any map in &lt;strong&gt;Sunpy&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked the end of the community bonding phase of the project and in the coming weeks, I’ll be working on experimenting with rotation and &lt;strong&gt;AstroPy’s SkyCoord&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll also be working on some plotting field lines from &lt;strong&gt;PfssPy&lt;/strong&gt; which would add some extra functionality to the library. I’ve finally gotten into getting my hands dirty with the code and I’m loving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much it for the first fortnight with &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;, looking forward to see how this project turns out, everything seems to be going well and I’m grateful to be working on this project with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
