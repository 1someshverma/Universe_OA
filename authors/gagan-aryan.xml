This blog is the first in the series of those blogs and will contain a quick overview of what Google Summer of Code is, an intro to the organization I will be working with and the project I will be involved in, and what I did in the 20-day community bonding period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-gsoc"&gt;What is GSoC?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember attending one of Programming Club IIT Kanpur’s lectures in my freshman year of college, and my senior just asked the students if they knew what GSoC was. I had no idea. But I glanced over to see if my peers knew something and saw a few of them nodding enthusiastically and a few others muttering among themselves. The senior didn’t explain what GSoC was, but he did ask us to check it out ourselves. I did. I wouldn’t save I understood the entire program back then since I didn’t even know what open source was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward around 9-10 months, I started contributing to open source. I really felt it helped me skill up as a developer, which motivated me to participate in GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code or GSoC is a program sponsored by Google that aims to connect university students worldwide with open source organizations to promote the open-source culture. Students work with an open-source organization on a 10-week programming project during their break from school and get an opportunity to contribute to high-quality code, learn new skills, and also get compensated for the work. In turn, the organizations benefit from a few extra pairs of helping hands. Any college student interested in software development should definitely check out this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="radis-and-my-project"&gt;Radis and my project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radis&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a fast line-by-line code for synthesizing and fitting infrared absorption and emmision spectra such as encountered in laboratory plasmas or exoplanet atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radis aims to provide a wide array of features and remain user-friendly at the same so. It currently supports spectral calculations on databases like HTIRAN and high-temperature databases like HITEMP, CDSD-4000 with a future plan on extending the support to ExoMol. It comes with just a one-line install and post-processing tools for analysis of the spectra. Users can also combine ranges to create a mixture of gases or calculate radiative transfer along the line-of-sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RADIS uses Pandas dataframe for handling all the databases currently. Quoting the words of Wes (the core dev of Pandas), “pandas rule of thumb: have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of the dataset” &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Which makes it impossible to read, say, a database of size 5GB on a machine with a RAM of 16GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pandas Meme" src="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/images/gsoc-0/pandas_meme.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project would be first to reduce the memory usage of the current calculations. Then, we replace pandas with libraries that are better suited for handling larger-than-memory databases, which would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (of the scale of hundreds of GB or terabytes). I will say the core technical details of the project for the upcoming blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="community-bonding-period"&gt;Community Bonding Period&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Community Bonding Period is an almost 20-days long period meant to serve as a warm-up or a buffer before the actual coding period begins. It can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as getting a better understanding of the codebase and figuring out its intricacies. I started out by quickly going over Spectro-102&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; again since I had left out a few parts the last time I did. I then studied the RADIS &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; paper. Though I cannot really say the entire document, I did get a top-level idea of how it works and how it is different from other software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="my-failed-attempts-in-wrapping-up-the-previous-work"&gt;My failed attempts in wrapping up the previous work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my GSoC application, I started working on a feature request that asked a specific function in the code to return the wavelength and the intensity grid in sorted ascending order. I just assumed that all I need to do was sort the grids, and I did this and created a PR. I later learned that Radis, like any good codebase, has many tests that make sure things don’t break when a new change is made. Apparently, returning the wavelengths and intensity grid in the sorted order broke the physics when combining spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this PR, I was unaware of &lt;code&gt;pytests&lt;/code&gt;. I went through the documentation&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ran the tests on my machine, and checked out each of the failing tests. This helped me understand different parts of the code, especially the &lt;code&gt;spectrum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;los&lt;/code&gt; modules of the repository. The tests passed of the &lt;code&gt;spectrum&lt;/code&gt; module passed after a few modifications. But, after I updated Erwan regarding my progress, I realized that I need to now design new tests since we cannot pinpoint where we are having problems in the codebase with the existing ones. Besides, I learned about the different types of tests (non-regression, validation, and verification) that exist in RADIS to ensure things don’t break after a brief chat with Erwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have decided how we will tackle this issue, but since I am required to start on my project from tomorrow, I will be getting back to this PR later and hope to find time for the same during the coding period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="discovery-during--hitemp-co2h2o-download-automation"&gt;Discovery during HITEMP (CO2/H2O) download automation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of my project, I am required to use a few hacks&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the pandas and boost their memory performance. This includes dropping a few columns and changing the datatypes of a few others. Coincidentally Dirk encountered an issue while working on automating the download of CO2/H2O for HITEMP. So, CO2/H2O spectral databases contain multiple zip files, and automatic download of this was not supported in RADIS. Due to NaN values and the &lt;code&gt;np.uint&lt;/code&gt; not supporting them, the datatypes of a few columns conflicted when databases were added on top of one another. Currently, this is being handled by returning the parameters in the form of a memory inefficient &lt;code&gt;np.float64&lt;/code&gt;. I will have to bring them down to more suitable datatypes (&lt;code&gt;np.uint&lt;/code&gt;) most probably. This will probably be the first thing I will do as part of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-next-two-weeks"&gt;The next two weeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next two weeks I will be involved in figuring out and implement all the database pre-processing that can be done to boost pandas’ performance&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://gagan-aryan.netlify.app/tags/gsoc21//index.xml#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I will also setup memory performance benchmarks to track these changes. I am super excited to see how this project goes. I would like to thank Google, OpenAstronomy, RADIS and my mentors &lt;a href="https://github.com/erwanp"&gt;Erwan Pannier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dcmvdbekerom"&gt;Dirk van den Bekerom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/pkj-m"&gt;Pankaj Mishra&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to learn a lot of stuff along the way and hopefully I will deliver. So,&lt;/p&gt;
