Hello everyone! During the last two weeks, I’ve been finishing primary perturbation goals and was studying the robust Kepler equation solution proposed in the paper “Robust resolution of Kepler’s equation in all eccentricity regimes”, Davide Farnocchia et al. The guy now works in NASA, actually :)So `...READ MORE... <https://medium.com/@nikita.astronaut/solar-drag-and-robust-kepler-equation-solution-694a4658c35b?source=rss-38faf7894114------2>`__
