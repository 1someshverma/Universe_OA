    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>How are you?</p>
    <p>So, it's been two weeks of astropy@GSoC work already. Of course I have been damn busy! With the last commit made to the draft PR <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835">https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835</a>, a few hours back, I have successfully written a basic CDS writer. And voilà it works, albeit without the ReadMe at present! 😁</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>Note that I am quite unlikely to go into technical details here in these posts. There are two reasons for this. Hhm..., Na I guess there's just one single reason. It would be too repetitive a task to write them. I already write aplenty about those in the GitHub comments and other communications. And of course, the whole codes I am writing during the project are available publicly on GitHub, for the overly curious kind. Moreover, the final report is gonna have more than ample discussion too, because I like to explain myself a lot. 😐 What then is the need to write all that here again? So consider these posts my plain uncouth thoughts, which in any case, I suppose, aligns more with the spirit OpenAstronomy asks these for.</p>
    <p>On a second important point, honestly, these Astropy people are really intelligent. It would appear, even more as the project progresses, that they knowingly marked a normal project as <i>Easy</i>&nbsp;to lure some innocent students! 😂</p>
    <p>Anyway, Bye.</p>
    <p>See ya the next time! 🙋‍♂️</p>
