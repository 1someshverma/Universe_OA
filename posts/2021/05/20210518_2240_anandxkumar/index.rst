    <p>Hey everyone <b>Anand Kumar</b> this side. This is going to be a series of blogs where I will cover my Summer Journey with <b>Radis</b> organization as a part of Google Summer of Code. Welcome to my first blog where I will be introducing myself coz that is kind of necessary :p. I’m a Junior from National
    Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering.<br /></p>
    <p>I am a geek. I love life, computers and everything in between!<br />
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    I have been coding since my school days and soon realized that man this thing is so cool!
    I am an A.I. enthusiast and have made various projects related to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
    and Web Development. Also I have completed a Data Analytics Internship at Pikkal &#x26; Co, Singapore and a
    Deep Learning Internship at Mavoix Solutions Pvt Ltd, Bangalore.<br />
    Currently I’m a Student Developer at OpenAstronomy organization as a part of Google Summer of Code 2021. <br /></p>
    <p>Wanna know a less known fact, I’m a huge hardcore video gamer! If I’m not coding, I will probably be killing some time
    on my laptop or my Playstation console ;)</p>
    <p>Wanna know more about me and my work? Below are some links, do check out;)<br />

    | <a href="https://anandkumar.netlify.app/">Portfolio</a></p>
    <p>Also one huge shout out to the guys at <b>GatsbyJS</b> for providing such an amazing blogging template(keep it simple and clean, they say!).
    The biggest advantage of this template is that every blog is written in <b>Markdown</b>. So its gives alot of flexibility and functionality
    to the user to edit their texts. Plus their templates codebase is easy to understand so anyone can just clone and get started!</p>
    <p>Anyways I guess this should wrap up this blog. See you in the next one where I will be starting my GSoC journey and discuss my project ;)<br />
    Till then take care and ba-bye :)</p>
