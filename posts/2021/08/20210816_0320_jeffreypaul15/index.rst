    <p>From when I’ve started writing these blog posts, I’ve taken quite a liking to writing these blog posts (except for the one fortnight I missed). OpenAstronomy has helped me improve the way I express myself in a satirical manner. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what’s the plan for my future but let’s save that story for another day.</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y0Rim-lsXAAtQbRuk6-37A.jpeg" /><figcaption>Here’s picture of sun and its field lines to show that I’m working on astronomy related, but actually have no proper knowledge of how any of this works, cheers! 🍻</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a bit of how my last week of “officially” working on Sunkit-Pyvista went :-</p>
    <ol><li>We put a pin on the animator as it didn’t make sense for us to work on something that isn’t of more value for the first release.</li><li>Pfsspy field lines now allow for a custom color function to be passed while plotting.</li><li>All main functionality is big-free (as far as I know) and can be used efficiently without having to worry about something failing.</li><li>The final boss with our little project is trying to get the documentation to render 3D plots correctly and this is being handled by the mentors which is a huge load off my head.</li></ol><p>That’s pretty much it I guess, these last few PRs mark the end of the so called “GSoC” period. What more have I left out? I’ve spoken about everything there is to be said, we’re nearing the end of this pretty interesting journey that I had embarked on. Other than a small bit of sadness, I’ve got nothing else to say. I’ve decided to continue working on Sunkit-Pyvista as being an open-sourced contributor is all about the community and I’m doing my part in working towards that (It’s not like I was planning on leaving either way though, this is almost a part of my daily routine).</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>Here’s to Sunpy and the best mentors I’ve interacted with. 🍻</p>
