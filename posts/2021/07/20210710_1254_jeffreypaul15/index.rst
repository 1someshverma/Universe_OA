    <h3>Not just Python</h3><p>Sunkit-Pyvista is doing quite well as of today, this goes without saying due to the fact the the Sunpy developers put in quite a bit of effort into reading all the stuff that I write and they do carefully review them.</p>
    <p>That being said, I’ve personally faced no a few issues with getting things to work as they are. I don’t have much to say about this project except the fact that I’m super stoked about it and it has been going super well.</p>
    <p>I get to write code from scratch that’s turned into an actual project that would help someone, I also get to learn stuff that I never saw myself doing. From tinkering around with CircleCI to getting documentation to work the way we want them to, this project seems like the ideal one for a python developer like me.</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>To summarize what happened over the past few weeks —</p>
    <ul><li>We’ve gotten over most of the project and we’re now working towards the initial stuff we put a pin in.</li><li>The basic plotting functionality of Sunpy now exists with Sunkit-Pyvista.</li><li>We moved the documentation over to GitHub workflows and I’m hoping that we get it to work by the end of the month.</li><li>We’ve introduced animations as a new feature to our work and we’ve got some ideas with how to take this forward.</li></ul><p>Having no prior experience with Astrophysics, I decided to give Stephen Hawking’s “The Theory of Everything” a read. (Well, not a read, I prefer listening to audio books even though they are inferior). Revisiting physics with an astronomical sense gave me such a new perspective on what I am doing and fueled the motivation to continue the project with the same excitement I began with.</p>

Who knows what the future holds for me, I’ve always been anxious about that. At times like these I try to think of how this universe is so nondeterministic, we may have a few guesses and theories as to why things happen the way it does but, we can’t say for sure. This thought grounds my thoughts and I suddenly stop worrying about everything, for sometime at-least…</p>
