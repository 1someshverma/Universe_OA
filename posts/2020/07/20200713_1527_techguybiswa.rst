    <p>Time flies. <br>
    It feels like yesterday that I joined DiRAC virtually and now that I look back, already a month and a half!</p>
    <p>It has been a really amazing journey so far and I have learned a lot, wrote a lot of code and have worked with some really nice people.</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>The most challenging aspect was connecting everything and putting everything together.</p>
    <p>I was working on an Ipython kernel extension, a Jupyter Notebook Front end extension, and on a python backend extension.</p>
    <p>I had to integrate REST APIs to connect the Front end with the backend and create socket communications to connect the front end with the ipython kernel.</p>
    <p>It was fun and challenging.</p>
    <p><strong>The features I added this week are:</strong></p>
    <ol><li>Saving the state of the extension across multiple devices</li><li>Customizing the cluster config from the front end</li></ol><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7bfd02021440" width="1" height="1">
