    <h4>Look at where we are, look at where we started.</h4><p>This post marks the halfway point of the GSoC journey. Instead of my usual full blown update posts, I want to celebrate this milestone with just a small, solemn reflection on the work we have accomplished so far.</p>
    <p>We have the Search Events up and running that maps the Sunspotter observation to the <a href="https://www.lmsal.com/hek/">Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK)</a>. This has broadened our dataset and will allow us to do timeseries analysis in the near future.</p>
    <p>We also have a Sunspotter class that handles the various CSVs and the AR FITS files.<br>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    The Sunspotter class allows us to rotate each observation to the nearest midnight, and convert observations from theHelioprojective frame to HeliographicStonyHurst frame.</p>
    <p>We have a few Neural Nets showing good prediction results.</p>
    <p>But all of these are technical details.</p>
    <p>What really has been a strangely new experience for me is the sense of collaboration. My mentors do not treat this as a project that I have to do and they have to guide. I’ve interacted with a lot of students from a lot of different orgs in the past few two and a half months. OpenAstronomy is different and unique in its sense of prioritising community.<br>
    I know it’s a running theme, but I can’t find the words to describe how grateful I am, how exciting and fun this project has been because of my mentors and the SunPy community at large.<br>
    Looking forward to the next half of the journey! :)</p>
