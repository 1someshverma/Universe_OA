Everything was great, I was chilling out at my Campus <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in">IIT Mandi</a> until the Corona thing happened. It changed my google search results for “Corona” from this …</p>

I enjoyed Planetarium trips, national competitions; even remembering just numerical data about the cosmos! Fast-forwarding a few years, I’m at IIT Mandi completing my bachelor in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>The best thing happened to me at my institute was STAC…</p>

I was selected as a coordinator of the Club and organized various astronomy sessions as telescope night outs with students of our institute. I got to learn and engage in a lot of astrophysics and python owing to the open-source culture established by our seniors in the STAC and Programming Club of IIT Mandi.</p>
    <p>I actively coordinated in organizing AstraX (the annual Astro-meet) which also witnessed Dr. Stuart Mumord and Dr. Nick Murphy as keynote speakers. I introduced students of a local college with using Python for Astronomy in an event sponsored by Python Software Foundation.</p>

I initially started my contributions to <a href="http://github.com/STAC-IITMandi">STAC Github repositories</a>. I opened some issues, created silly PRs, and messed up my git history many times while resolving reviews. Looking at those PRs now, I feel grateful to those who patiently reviewed them. I went through many StackOverflow threads to fix my git sins.</p>

I lagged in community interaction as I felt shy and started very late. Thus, my proposal wasn’t accepted. I decided to give it a go again in 2020. I started early and joined several chat channels(mostly of organizations under <a href="https://openastronomy.org/">OpenAstronomy</a>) for interacting with developers out there.</p>
    <h3>Me and SunPy</h3><p>I started with exploring raised issues on the repository and expressed a desire to work on the trivial ones initially. Though I was quite comfortable dealing with conflicts but contributed to a repo with a thorough test-suite for the first time. I was helped a lot by the<a href="http://sunpy.org"> SunPy</a> community with my PRs and celebrated my first contribution in December of 2019. I owe a lot to the community; being part of them helped to polish my skills and increase my confidence.</p>

I tried to bring back the old client pull requests. After the ideas list was out, I was very excited to work on Fido(Federated Internet Data Obtainer).</p>
    <p>I was also invited to <em>Python in Astronomy</em> Hack Days that took place in April this year. I worked on adding a `Gong Synoptic Map Client for Fido` with <a href="http://github.com/dstansby"><strong><em>David Stansby</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

I was going to spend my summer on improving an interface which fetches solar physics data from satellites and observatories!</p>

I feel very fortunate to work with them. I am looking forward to having a great summer ahead in their awesome guidance!</p>
