A lot I learned from the community; a lot I contributed to it. What I took back from GSoC is way more than what I put forward for it. So let’s see what I did in the last weeks.</p>
    <p>I have now added a guide on how to Add “Attrs” to the registry in <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4387">PR #4387</a>. It is part of the developer guide for Fido.<br>
    I have added tests to check metadata queries in <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4385">#4385</a> and ways to index the results using the client’s name. It eases to retrieve individual provider responses from a Fido result.<br>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    I resolved all reviews so far on PR <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4419">#4419</a>, so now it will ease the merging of <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4321">PR #4321</a>.<br>
    They await review as of now, maybe merged within this week. In short, almost all the proposed goals were achieved in the project. I experienced a more “pythonic” way of coding. Discovered new heights of the language, learned some solar physics, and what matters most, became part of a great community. Hopefully I made <em>Fido Great Again!</em></p>
    <p><strong>CAPRE NOCTEM!</strong></p>
