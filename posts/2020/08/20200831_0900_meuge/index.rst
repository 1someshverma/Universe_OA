    <p>Contributing to Poliastro has been an incredible experience for me. Since it was the first time, I've participated in GSOC. And the first time I've ever approached to package dedicated to problems arising in Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics. Being part of Poliastro was an exciting challenge that I had to surmount and also an unbelievable opportunity to learn about Space, Math and Physics.</p>

    <p>With the thorough knowledge learned, and the feedback from JuanLu and Jorge, I was able to overcome every challenge in my Poliastro's journey. As I had said when I had the opportunity, I am grateful to both of my mentors who accepted me to be part of this exceptional community.  :)</p>
