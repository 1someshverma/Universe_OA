    <p>Hey, folks! The last weeks were really exciting getting done an algorithm for ground-track orbit. After long days trying to find the perfect approach for Poliastro, we decided to give it a go bringing to life this <a href="[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287869810_Daily_repeat-groundtrack_Mars_orbits">paper</a></p>
