On this post I am going to show a comparison between the different optimization algorithms implemented till now in CTLearn, all of them applied to the same telescope and with the same configuration. This is useful to find the similarities and differences between optimization methods, as well as chec `...READ MORE... <https://medium.com/@jrpg1996/in-depth-comparison-between-the-optimization-algorithms-implemented-31f3d8ea80af?source=rss-d64822a82f52------2>`__
