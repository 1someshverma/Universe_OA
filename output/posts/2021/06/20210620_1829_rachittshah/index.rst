    <p>Python, X-rays, and JSON files that don’t comply and make you cry.</p>
    <p>GSoC has officially started!</p>
    <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/0*AXMzJYLpLP0sFPgE" /><figcaption>We’re going to code!</figcaption></figure><p>Since is a Desktop App made with Electron and Python, my first priority was getting DAVE to compile again. The process was tedious and took a good amount of time to fix the flask backends which power DAVE.</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>Another error that came while getting DAVE up was that DAVE uses Stingray’s APIs which are lower than 2.0, which gave a lot of broken packages. Fixing this was something that would be covered in the POC enhancements, however, it was important to tackle this to build the MVP.</p>
    <p>Looked at some major changes in the coming 0.3 for Stingray and how to accommodate them, so we don’t have issues later.</p>
    <p>Had exams alongside, so the first week was less effort extensive for GSoC.</p>
    <p>Waiting for the next week to write more about my progress and journey!</p>
