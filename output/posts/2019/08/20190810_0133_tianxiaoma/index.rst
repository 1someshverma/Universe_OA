In this week, I started to move to Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models. I am going to make an introduction to these models in this post.PFSS models are aiming to solve the magnetic field satisfying∇ × B = 0, ∇ · B = 0in a spherical region with appropriate boundary conditions. Therefore, thi `...READ MORE... <https://medium.com/@tianxiaoma/start-to-work-on-pfss-28f6e2fe2141?source=rss-32c99f71920a------2>`__
