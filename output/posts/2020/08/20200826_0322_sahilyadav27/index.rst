    <p>The past 3 months have been really amazing. I’ve learned a lot about working on a collaborative project and working with deadlines.</p>
    <p>In the past two weeks, I polished off the work done for the project in the PR, so that it is ready to merge. There were a few merge conflicts that needed to be addressed.</p>
    <p>Then, I worked on a generate_runlist file to make runlists for converting MAGIC ROOT data to HDF5 data. In a few days, training will start on the approximately 5000 MAGIC data runs using CTLearn’s models.</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>I’ll be continuing to work and contribute to this project in the future as required as well. Hopefully this will be useful for researchers working on related problems in the future.</p>
    <p>I’m grateful for my mentors, Google, and OpenAstronomy for this amazing GSoC 2020 experience. Signing off!</p>
