An activation function is used to introduce non-linearity to a network. This allows us to model a class label / score that varies non-linearly with independent variables. Non-linear means the output cannot be replicated from a linear combination of inputs, this allows the model to learn complex mapp `...READ MORE... <https://adl1995.github.io/an-overview-of-activation-functions-used-in-neural-networks.html>`__
