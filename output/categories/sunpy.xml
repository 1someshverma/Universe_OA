Everything was great, I was chilling out at my Campus &lt;a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in"&gt;IIT Mandi&lt;/a&gt; until the Corona thing happened. It changed my google search results for “Corona” from this …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3Y4pwOLqZTZfpojp.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Stellar Corona; Image Source: Wikipedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this :/&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoyed Planetarium trips, national competitions; even remembering just numerical data about the cosmos! Fast-forwarding a few years, I’m at IIT Mandi completing my bachelor in Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing happened to me at my institute was STAC…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/1*5QVxaKqpE8zu8diAswRskw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;STAC’s telescope assembled for Moon observations, place: SAC Terrace, IIT Mandi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAC is&lt;a href="http://stac.iitmandi.co.in"&gt; Space Technology and Astronomy Cell&lt;/a&gt; of IIT Mandi which allowed not only to continue my passion for Astronomy but also to develop interest among my juniors. I was selected as a coordinator of the Club and organized various astronomy sessions as telescope night outs with students of our institute. I got to learn and engage in a lot of astrophysics and python owing to the open-source culture established by our seniors in the STAC and Programming Club of IIT Mandi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actively coordinated in organizing AstraX (the annual Astro-meet) which also witnessed Dr. Stuart Mumord and Dr. Nick Murphy as keynote speakers. I introduced students of a local college with using Python for Astronomy in an event sponsored by Python Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Newspaper cutting, image of students organizing a coding session" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kr7WdXYIvAjcV8jCDIGq4Q.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bhavya Bhatt, Tanmay Rustagi and I featured in a local newspaper for organizing a PSF workshop.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Stepping in the world of Open-Source&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to “What is Open-Source?” and “how to use git?” in my first year. I initially started my contributions to &lt;a href="http://github.com/STAC-IITMandi"&gt;STAC Github repositories&lt;/a&gt;. I opened some issues, created silly PRs, and messed up my git history many times while resolving reviews. Looking at those PRs now, I feel grateful to those who patiently reviewed them. I went through many StackOverflow threads to fix my git sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Github page for STAC" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*1bgYWGu7_G_pIuBDpFDxMg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;STAC on GitHub&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I applied to LSF for GSoC 2019. I lagged in community interaction as I felt shy and started very late. Thus, my proposal wasn’t accepted. I decided to give it a go again in 2020. I started early and joined several chat channels(mostly of organizations under &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/a&gt;) for interacting with developers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Me and SunPy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with exploring raised issues on the repository and expressed a desire to work on the trivial ones initially. Though I was quite comfortable dealing with conflicts but contributed to a repo with a thorough test-suite for the first time. I was helped a lot by the&lt;a href="http://sunpy.org"&gt; SunPy&lt;/a&gt; community with my PRs and celebrated my first contribution in December of 2019. I owe a lot to the community; being part of them helped to polish my skills and increase my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1019/1*UA6AADBLzoCBhCDFe5aX6g.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;My first pull request in SunPy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The `net` submodule was more intriguing for me. I tried to bring back the old client pull requests. After the ideas list was out, I was very excited to work on Fido(Federated Internet Data Obtainer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also invited to &lt;em&gt;Python in Astronomy&lt;/em&gt; Hack Days that took place in April this year. I worked on adding a `Gong Synoptic Map Client for Fido` with &lt;a href="http://github.com/dstansby"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Stansby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Video screenshot of PyAstro HackDay" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ccxtL1B6_-3sefvoKdushg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;PyAstro conference hackday liverstream screenshot | Solar magnetic field maps for pfsspy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 11:00 PM IST on the 4th of May, I received an email from Google. I was going to spend my summer on improving an interface which fetches solar physics data from satellites and observatories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jT0kvnSy94TwIw9ewb069g.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6648215463526400"&gt;GSoC Project Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a meeting with my mentors &lt;a href="http://github.com/cadair"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuart Mumford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;a href="https://github.com/nabobalis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nabil Frei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;j &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;to formalize the full scope of the project. I feel very fortunate to work with them. I am looking forward to having a great summer ahead in their awesome guidance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=d8af558ad399" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/05/20200519_0513_abhijeetmanhas/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 04:13:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2020: glue-solar project 0.1</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/05/20200517_0228_kakirastern/</link><dc:creator>Kris Stern</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel grateful for having been selected for the second time in a row to participate in &lt;strong&gt;GSoC&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/strong&gt; organization with &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt; as the sub-organization. My mentors this year are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomas Robitaille, Stuart Mumford, and Nabil Freij&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, whom I have come to know within the astrophysics community over the past year or so and have come to respect. I am definitely looking forward to having a summer of serious fun with glue (or glueviz) in order to develop a plugin called glue-solar for use in solar physics data visualization. But to start I simply cannot resist delving more deeply into the glue-solar project. First off, here is a &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5824429948403712"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to my project description over at GSoC’s official website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce the glue-solar plugin, it is only natural to first introduce the glue package for which it operates on. As its official &lt;a href="http://glueviz.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; would suggest, glue is a package for multi-dimensional linked-data exploration. With glue, users can generate scatter plots, histograms, and both 2D and 3D images of their own data. The package emphasizes on the brushing and linking paradigm, where selections in any graph can propagate to all others. Moreover, glue uses the existing logical links between different data sets to overlay visualizations of different datasets, and to propagate the same selections across all other data sets. To clarify, these can be spatial and temporal links. These links are specified by the user, and are designed to be arbitrarily flexible. Finally, glue is written in Python, and built on top of its standard scientific libraries (e.g., Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy), such that users can easily integrate their own python code for data input, cleaning, and analysis, enabling full scripting capability.&lt;/p&gt;

This software will enable multi-instrument interactive visualisation as a &lt;strong&gt;plugin&lt;/strong&gt; of glue. While a fully featured GUI toolkit for solar data is not expected to be built in one summer due to time constraint, the goal is to provide the technical building blocks, but more importantly to demonstrate, and document, how this framework can be used by various instrument teams to build custom solutions for their solar data. Glue-solar, like glue is completely free for anyone to use and is open-source. Furthermore, glue-solar is a collaboration between glue and SunPy, hence its focus on solar physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official start date of this year’s GSoC is June 2nd, 2020, immediately after the current community bonding period. But work has already begun and we have already opened pull requests (or PRs) at both the glue and glue-solar repos to enable loading of basic SunPy maps such as AIA and HMI data so that they can be overplotted as different colormaps. As per usual, GSoC will last for about three months, until August 25th, 2020. This summer is surely going to be filled with many fun hours of coding for both glue and glue-solar for me. I am definitely looking forward to enjoying working on my last GSoC project this year, with my amazing mentors’ guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

The mountain is named after &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_(goddess)"&gt;Annapurna&lt;/a&gt;, the Hindu goddess of food and nourishment, who is said to reside there. The name Annapurna is derived from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;-language words &lt;em&gt;purna&lt;/em&gt; (“filled”) and &lt;em&gt;anna&lt;/em&gt; (“food”), and can be translated as “everlasting food”, which also symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;contentment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Ode to the Sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember much of my childhood. I mean, most of us don’t, but I have a particularly poor memory. &lt;br&gt;
One of the earliest memories that I do remember, however, is my mom getting me this thin blue picture book from the Sunday flea market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this strange orange-yellow orb on the cover that got my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Our Sun&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my seven-year-old self, the book didn’t make sense. The sun was supposed to be a big ball of fire in the sky. I think we had an agreement over this. Now, what do you mean by this &lt;em&gt;fusion-fission &lt;/em&gt;jargon? And what in the world are nuclei? More importantly, how am I supposed to pronounce this word in the first place ?! We must excuse seven-year-old me for this aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mom’s credit, she simply asked me to read more. To the thin blue book’s credit, it simply said that nuclei were like bricks but really really really small. They made up the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;So far so good.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fission was breaking these bricks, Fusion was joining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Hmmm, cool, if you say so.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like when a firecracker explodes, it produces energy, fission does so too!&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;em&gt;Imagines Diwali fireworks&lt;/em&gt; * “&lt;em&gt;Yep. This ain’t that difficult to wrap my head around.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, in Fusion you get these bricks together real real close it produces more energy apparently. *Chapter ends*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;But Firecrackers, when mushed together, don’t explode! This makes no sense!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be years before I would finally understand nuclear fusion in all its magnificent glory. I say years because it hasn’t happened as of yet. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my fondest memories. All those summer days I spent reading encyclopedias; all those science projects; reading about plants eating the sun through this process called photosynthesis and instantly being enamoured by biology; reading about glucose (that sweet sweet molecule) and being fascinated by chemistry (though chemistry would later haunt my high school years); learning that math could serve as a bridge between all these seemingly unrelated ideas. And the ecstasy. Oh lord, that dopamine rush when you finally understood a concept!&lt;br&gt;
All of it started on a cosy Sunday afternoon with that thin blue book about the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, now in my sophomore year pursuing a Bachelor of Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, I am a nervous kid who thinks he knows nothing. I mean take away stack overflow and what am I but a pretender? Surrounded by tech overlords conversing in bash commands where I struggle with C pointers. : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know about GSoC from my seniors (my college has a pretty cool GSoC participation culture) and I decided this was it. This would be my tech redemption saga!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I needed now was an Org. &lt;br&gt;
And to get over my dread of open source and imposter syndrome. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here my struggle began (continued, formalized?). I couldn’t understand **any** codebase. In retrospect, mostly because I felt that a mere mortal wasn’t competent enough to understand this holy cypher written by them tech titans. I tried at least ten different orgs. Lurked in their chats, texted so many people asking for guidance. Never actually implementing any of their suggestions though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months of going nowhere and on the brink of convincing myself that GSoC wasn’t gonna happen this year, I happen to find myself on the Python Software Foundation’s GSoC site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Friends of the PSF: OpenAstronomy &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, seems interesting….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunPy, for Solar Physics. Might as well check out its good first issues. Some docstring fixes about sorting something by dates, which I somehow understood. I go to my friend’s room, nervously asking him about making PRs (Because I was too dumb not to learn&lt;em&gt; git &lt;/em&gt;beforehand), git commands and stuff.&lt;br&gt;
And just like it, magic happened. I made my first real PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t solve the issue and the maintainers had to make suggestions in the comments, effectively solving the issue themselves. But it was my PR! I made this! And so, in December 2019, the sun, which got me started in STEM in the first place, came back in my life when I needed it the most. SunPy took me in with open arms. Whatever I do in my professional life in the future, whatever I make, whatever I achieve, it would be because of the guidance given by and more importantly the kindness shown by, the SunPy community to that novice, hacking away at sorting by dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five months later, I can’t fathom how much I’ve grown. From a kid too scared to read code, lest he is confronted by his incompetence and inability to understand it, to actually founding my own organization for wildfire data analysis! More on that, sometime else :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code, with all the prestige and praise it gets me, would be the first major milestone in my professional life. But that doesn’t matter. SunPy has already given me so much.&lt;br&gt;
Skills, a loving community, a sense of purpose and most importantly, confidence and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I can’t describe what rush of excitement I felt as I clicked on that green button asking me if I wanted to make that PR.&lt;br&gt;
I do know what went through my mind right after I clicked on it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheer Panic.&lt;br&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sunpy-bot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, what in the world is a changelog and what do you mean this PR doesn’t have it? Oh Lord, did I break something already?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;
