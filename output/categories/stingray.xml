Such an extended timeline could provide many benefits, such as the ability to work on more complex and sophisticated projects, more time to collaborate and improve, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;First Evaluation&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another noteworthy thing concerning GSoC that happened in the last week was that the results of the first evaluation were declared, and while most cleared it, some didn’t. Although there is little to no need to question their abilities, sometimes life just doesn’t go as planned; it seems easy to say that that’s what the real test is, nevertheless it can quickly become something tricky to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What next?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the “proposed” work has been done, I will now be preparing some tutorials for the newly added functionality and tools, in an attempt to reduce the barrier to experimentation, use, and possible adoption of these new techniques into the workflow of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while this could take a good amount of time if quality is needed, there will surely some be time to play around with other things, but what exactly will end up happening will be answered by time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=b6f9ec014333" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210719_1916_dhruv9vats/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Month into GSoC</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210705_2037_dhruv9vats/</link><dc:creator>Dhruv Vats</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s almost been a month since the start of GSoC’s coding period and the work, I’m glad to write, is progressing at a steady and satisfactory rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Developments&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time around, my first ever not-so-meaningless contribution to open-source had just got merged, and I was really happy about it. But what that also did was, get me over the initial anxiety and intimidation I might have been feeling towards open-source. This, I think, has also helped speed things along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I started working on the optional features of my project around 2 weeks ago, I had to scrape the initial implementation because it turned out to be very, very slow and therefore had to be completely replaced with a better and more efficient approach, which was a bit less straightforward. But now, two weeks into experimenting and iterating, a new pull-request has been opened with the newly implemented efficient version of the feature, and while it's still a few minor commits away from its final form, the core functionality works as expected and, if everything goes as expected, which is never a guarantee, a hefty part of my proposal’s objectives will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while this does not guarantee anything, I’d be lying if I said that I am not hoping for something exciting to do as I might have time to try out other things. What exactly, I honestly don’t know, but if I find myself in that minority who actually like what there doing, it’ll be an absolute privilege, which I’m looking forward to and wishing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DvmM4lhclsVa5tIwl5um4A.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Just some pastel colors for you to look at&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Goal&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows might be a very steep change in topic, but is one, that I think lies at the root of many seemingly normal activities. This is just something that has been on my mind lately, and what writing is, if not a tool to better understand yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like an invisible aura is building around me saying that you are at a stage in life where you need to man up, where you should have everything together and figured out, but whenever I try and assess myself in this context, I always, without fail, fell short of it and by a good margin. While the contrasting opposite of this would be saying that I am everything I ever wanted to be and have nothing to work towards, would be outright arrogant and even dangerous, there must be a balance somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should I have it all figured out, what’s even the need? And while statements like these can be argued against using something like, because everyone is doing it, and this is the way, they give the vibes of being in a pipeline you’ve been pushed into and now have no option but to pass through. And this, I think, many will agree, is not a very desirable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need to progress towards something also spurs off many questions, one of which is “the why ?”. The why, is an oh-so-difficult question to answer that honestly makes me feel frustrated at times, not knowing to what end all the efforts are being put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be argued that this is a ridiculous thing to think about, and one should not set overly optimistic expectations, this, I feel, contradicts the notion of elegance that I somehow have associated with the fundamental workings of the world. If someone asked me to comment on the secrets of the Universe, I’d be very comfortable with using the words elegant and sophisticated, even though I basically know nothing about it? Why? Is this just a desire to find meaning in everything, or is there something else at play?&lt;/p&gt;

In this one, my plan for the next stage of implementation. Currently, I am working on the modeling notebook (&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks/blob/main/Modeling/ModelingExamples.ipynb"&gt;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks/blob/main/Modeling/ModelingExamples.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;) to re-design it using JAX, especially to make optimization more robust by having JAX compute gradients on the likelihood function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*u_c4S0h60T1IECOBQVTS1A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mentor Daniela highlighted the issue that the current implementation is not robust using NumPy. The plan is to keep working on the current modeling notebook replacing NumPy by jax.numpy and also use grad, jit, vmap, random functionality of JAX.&lt;br&gt;When it comes to re-design, understanding the current design and the possible drawback and issues with corresponding packages comes on you first and I am trying them out. One such challenge is importing emcee into jupyter notebook for sampling. Despite making sure, I download the dependency in the current virtual environment and then making sure I import emcee into the notebook, it is still acting weird and showing an error: emcee not installed! Can’t sample! It looks like a clash of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/240/1*JtGB50sLscB1BBPt9k3pfw.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trying to have fun while it lasts!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the plan is to solve every bug I face in the journey and then proceed with understanding how everything connects and the next step is to come up with the report of optimization using JAX. Stay tuned for more on how JAX can accelerate and augment the current modeling framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend one video for anyone who wants to understand the functionality of JAX better and relate more to my study (click &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVmRHMaOJ4&amp;amp;ab_channel=GoogleCloudTech"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Almost Done!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210621_1523_dhruv9vats/</link><dc:creator>Dhruv Vats</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only 2 weeks into the coding period, it feels good to say that the bulk of the work associated with the 2 milestones is &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;done. Almost because the newly added functionality is yet to be battle-tested and while there is always room for change and improvements, my focus will be shifting from the main objective to the optional objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Project&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific jargon ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study and interpretation of time-series data have become an integral part of modern-day astronomical studies and a common approach for characterizing the properties of time-series data is to estimate the power spectrum of the data using the periodogram. But the periodogram as an estimate suffers from being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statistically inconsistent (that is, its variance does not go to zero as the number of data samples reach infinity),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Biased for finite samples, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Suffers from spectral leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*5GHLU2O-S9d06amIH5ESBA.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Stingray is a spectral-timing software package for astrophysical X-ray (and other) data.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My project aimed at implementing and integrating a superior spectral estimation technique, known as the Multitaper periodogram, into a Software Package called Stingray, a sub-organization of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Multitaper algorithm uses windows or tapers (bell-shaped functions), which are multiplied with the time-series data before finding its frequency domain estimate. These windows, called the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), help mitigate the problems mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more technical stuff and this blog will start taking the shape of my proposal, so I’ll leave it here, but for anyone more interested, &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2m2p10en8ygpmz/Proposal.pdf?dl=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Process&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started working on the project in early March, before submitting the proposal, and it initially included writing a wrapper around an external package to make the use of this tool coherent with the rest of the project. While a proof-of-concept implementation was put together, it was later decided to use SciPy to do the grunt work, as it already was a dependency, somewhat changing the initial milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in a way, I was already working on the project before the results were announced and ended up opening a pull request with the newly added method 1 week into the coding period and it got merged a week later, which happened to be fairly early in the GSoC program coding timeline. Perks of open-source?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while there are sure to be improvements and additions in terms of coherency and features, this does give a bit more breathing room and time for experimentation and exploration, and I’ll try and make good use of it, primarily by working on the optional but quite good-to-have features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/578"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the PR.&lt;/p&gt;

Symbolic differentiation operates on expanded mathematical expressions which lead to inefficient code and introduction of truncation error while finite differentiation deals with round-off errors. Optimized calculation of derivatives is crucial when it comes to training neural networks or mathematical modeling using bayesian inference. Both classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Here, automatic differentiation comes to the rescue. Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NzyxsrkiLjjyjiIuCf123w.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Source: Wikipedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stingray is astrophysical spectral timing software, a library in python built to perform time series analysis and related tasks on astronomical light curves. JAX is a python library designed for high-performance numerical computing. Its API for numerical functions is based on NumPy, a collection of functions used in scientific computing. Both Python and NumPy are widely used and familiar, making JAX simple, flexible, and easy to adopt. It can differentiate through a large subset of python’s features, including loops, ifs, recursion, and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives. Such modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve the applicability, run time, and memory management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAX utilizes the grad function transformation to convert a function into a function that returns the original function’s gradient, just like Autograd. Beyond that, JAX offers a function transformation jit for just-in-time compilation of existing functions and vmap and pmap for vectorization and parallelization, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5hEIw7ou4eeAX-HnP_23_A.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mini-MLP(Multiple layer Perceptron) execution time for 10,000 updates with a batch size of 1024. Source: AI Zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As seen in the above figure, PyTorch has much more effective in terms of execution speed than TensorFlow when it came to implementing fully connected neural layers. For low-level implementations, on the other hand, JAX offers impressive speed-ups of an order of magnitude or more over the comparable Autograd library. JAX is faster than any other library when MLP implementation was limited to matrix multiplication operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we decide the ideal library to go with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/626/1*8-_tFBCgszXxQwkMEwEcjA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our choice will first depend on the history of the project we start working on, if the code already uses PyTorch then most probably we will end up using PyTorch for writing our code. For general differentiable programming with low-level implementations of abstract mathematical concepts, JAX offers substantial advantages in speed and scale over Autograd while retaining much of Autograd’s simplicity and flexibility, while also offering surprisingly competitive performance against PyTorch and TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSoC has officially started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/0*AXMzJYLpLP0sFPgE"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;We’re going to code!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since is a Desktop App made with Electron and Python, my first priority was getting DAVE to compile again. The process was tedious and took a good amount of time to fix the flask backends which power DAVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another error that came while getting DAVE up was that DAVE uses Stingray’s APIs which are lower than 2.0, which gave a lot of broken packages. Fixing this was something that would be covered in the POC enhancements, however, it was important to tackle this to build the MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at some major changes in the coming 0.3 for Stingray and how to accommodate them, so we don’t have issues later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had exams alongside, so the first week was less effort extensive for GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the next week to write more about my progress and journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code is probably the most notable and interesting programs a student can be a part of an undergrad can be a part of. From reading GSoC blogs to write my story, it feels unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is more of an introduction to GSoC and my project at OpenAstronomy, I’ll be covering my prep and journey later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About my GSoC project!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VCNaN41xLMATNTgC"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The DAVE engine!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generating periodograms for astronomical data is the core task of Stingray. Because periodograms are often noisy, several methods to denoise periodograms exist in the literature, among them the multi-taper periodogram Stingray aims to provide a comprehensive library of reliable, well-tested implementations of common algorithms for time series analysis in Astronomy. DAVE is an elegant GUI to the library, developed during a previous GSoC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to the fast-evolving Python and Javascript landscape, this GUI is not compatible with the current versions of the dependencies. Also, Stingray has now new features that were not implemented in the original GUI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this project, I would be refreshing the GUI dependencies, update the package building infrastructure, and add the new functionality introduced in recent versions of Stingray.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be making sure DAVE would be up and running again over the summer, couldn’t have been happier!&lt;/p&gt;

As far as statistics are concerned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% of the world’s top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;96.3% of the world’s top 1 million servers run on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;85% of all smartphones are based on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it suffices to say that most people have used OpenSource software one way or the other. But how does that concern me? A budding mind in the computing industry should have some familiarity with OpenSource, is an understatement. And that's where Google Summer of Code comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight from its landing page,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Motivation&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While talking about the intricacies of computing and its sophisticated relationship with science is a rabbit hole as deep as any, let’s talk motivation for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, I believe, is an inherent property of consciousness. This curiosity is most exposed in children, who, if you look for it, are intrigued by almost everything around them and try and understand it better. While this curiosity and the silly questions that come with it are overwhelmed by the problems of the here and now as we grow up, I think it is rather pleasant to visit those silly questions every so often, as the answers to some of them could tick off a line of thought that leads to discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such revelating thought that I had and has stuck with me is when the idea of the vastness of the Universe started sinking in. I know, big words, but bear with me. As philosophical as it may sound, the thought that my existence is just an inconceivable dot on yet another pale blue dot from far away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*4bvU5y61XMwH8E_wmKLdCw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A photograph of planet Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Voyager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; 1. &lt;/em&gt;Seen from about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), Earth appears as a tiny dot within deep space: the blueish-white speck almost halfway up the brown band on the right. Source: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;was a comforting one. Why? I don’t know. But one thing this did was reignite my curiosity to better understand the world around me, and my place in it. While the discussion of the latter becomes too philosophical too soon, it is the former for which I’m writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Resistance&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Earth, where sadly all my burdens still exist and I’m mostly consumed in “my little world”, I was quite intimidated by how little I knew, especially by the people on the Internet. While such a comparison is unjustified and foolish, this did become a roadblock that was amplified by this feeling that my work should amount to something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And considering where my career was headed it was time I let go of this feeling and actually start doing stuff. This, I think, is where OpenSource helps in that it has a place for you to contribute to no matter your skill level, while also constantly encouraging you to get better. You just have to put yourself out there, a challenge for someone like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is that Google Summer of Code does an excellent job of bridging the transition between learning stuff and actually doing something with that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I2MgGZwscyP4AjM2LGpYTA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h5&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this idea of me working on discovering stuff in the Universe is still as dreamy as ever, I would jump at an opportunity that would take me a step closer to that, if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in touch with one of OpenAstronomy’s sub-organizations, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt;, in February this year and started working on an algorithm used for better spectral estimation of time-series data as I had gained some familiarity with time-series data in my coursework. It was during the time when I was implementing the algorithm that I was given a time-series dataset to play around with. It was observed by an X-ray telescope as individual light photons hit its detector from the gas falling from a star into a black hole as they orbited around each other in a binary system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just awakened the fascinated child inside of me and became the main motivation for working with OpenAstronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to an exciting and different summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Cool Concepts?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a discussion about the Universe, life, and meaning is a thrill, constantly being in a state of mind where one does not lose such perspective is a different feat altogether. This perspective, which among other things, encourages one to ask those silly but fundamental questions, is something I long to have.&lt;/p&gt;

It can peer back into primordial times to show images of how the universe looked like around a quarter of a billion years after the Big Bang when the first stars and galaxies started to form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation, a dreaded 10-letter word(just counted the number of letters😅) that brings stress and anxiety in everyone from a small kid to a golden-ager(sounds so much better than ‘old-person’ doesn’t it!!). The Cambridge dictionary defines evaluation &lt;em&gt;(noun)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ɪˌvæl.juˈeɪ.ʃən, &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;strong&gt;“ the process of judging or calculating the quality, importance, amount, or value of something”. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Evaluations bring the best or worst out of people. I work better under pressure, I am one of those guys who cannot work until the room is on fire😂(I have a better phrase but it doesn’t quite qualify as PG-13😜).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluations although simple(the procedure) in GSoC are a big deal as they determine if you get (cue the Heavenly choir sound effect) &lt;strong&gt;the monthly stipend&lt;/strong&gt;🤑, just kidding, they determine if the student will be allowed to continue their projects. There are three &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;main &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;evaluations, one after each month to quantify if the project achieves the goals that it intended to and if the time was utilized most efficiently for the greatest possible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand procedural information is pretty boring so let’s directly jump to the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Google FooBar Challenege&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FvygSOchRZWfDLrq4QB9GQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looks like an invitation from a secret society!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened at around 9:00 am on 9th of June, I had pulled an all-nighter and was half-asleep, finding ways to optimize stingray, when on typing _________ my browser window pivoted, the above image unfolded, my eyes widened, heartbeat skyrocketed, I looked in awe at my screen and then blinked 100 times, washed my face to truly confirm what I was seeing was true. &lt;br&gt;
It was the GOOGLE FOOBAR CHALLENGE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is a coveted, hidden challenge, a special invitation that is only sent to a selected few(makes me feel like James Bond😜). FooBar is Google’s secret hiring challenge. Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization. &lt;br&gt;
Google sends an invitation based on one’s search history and problem-solving related keyword searches. If hidden magic in the Google search algorithm chooses you, you may receive an invitation for Google Foobar(makes me feel like Harry Potter😂).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice I instantly clicked &lt;em&gt;‘I want to play’. &lt;/em&gt;A black screen with a command-line interface greeted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sxh-YA_0437rxf5lu4r8mA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained; most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is essentially an online, time-bound Competitive Programming(CP) challenge with 5 rounds of increasing difficulty, each round having a different number of questions. &lt;br&gt;
To spice things up (both in terms of interest and difficulty) Google has a storyline, progressing through the challenges you are asked for a friend who you’d like to refer for the challenge and eventually some personal details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FooBar proved to be a great learning experience for me as I’m not proficient in CP. I felt that the main aim was not to test the skills and knowledge of an individual but also how quickly they could learn and implement solutions.&lt;br&gt;
To learn more about FooBar you could read this &lt;a href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First GSoC Evaluation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vw7I5eOtqMVRWRRLQcJKiw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Summer of Code Dashboard a friend who I only see once every month😂😂&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first evaluations were scheduled from the June 29, 2020 — July 3, 2020. My mentor Matteo and I had finalized on two main deliverables crucial for the foundations of the project. &lt;br&gt;
1. A &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;benchmark analysis report&lt;/a&gt; containing the time and memory benchmarks, profiling results for &lt;strong&gt;all the 31 functions&lt;/strong&gt;(3000+ lines of code)in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/lightcurve.py"&gt;Lightcurve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/powerspectrum.py"&gt;Powerspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/crossspectrum.py"&gt;Crossspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, AveragedPowerspectrum and AveragedCrossspectrum classes. &lt;br&gt;
2. Integrating &lt;a href="https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;airspeed velocity&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for benchmarking Python packages over their lifetime into stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark analysis report was a very time consuming yet possibly the most important step of the project. It singled out the functions that were causing the most delay and provided an overall estimate of the performance of stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking was performed in jupyter-notebooks. Data points of sizes ranging from 1,000(1K) to 100,000,000(100M) were used for benchmarking. For basic benchmarking, the %timeit and %memit magic commands were used. Two profilers &lt;a href="http://joerick.me/posts/2017/12/15/pyinstrument-20/"&gt;Pyinstrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile"&gt;CProfile&lt;/a&gt; were used to profile time and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/filprofiler/"&gt;filprofiler&lt;/a&gt; was used to profile memory use. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the CProfile were saved as a &lt;em&gt;.pstats&lt;/em&gt; file which was then visualized using &lt;a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/"&gt;Snakeviz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot"&gt;gprof2dot&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a graphical viewer and call-graph respectively. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the Pyinstrument and filprofiler were saved as HTML files.&lt;br&gt;
The results of the &lt;em&gt;%timeit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;%memit&lt;/em&gt; magic commands was visualized in an interactive &lt;a href="https://plotly.com/"&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; graph in the jupyter-notebook itself and also saved as an HTML file for easier access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all of this was &lt;strong&gt;535 &lt;/strong&gt;files&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ready for analysis, compiled into a &lt;strong&gt;74-page&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;9 &lt;/strong&gt;new GitHub issues and &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; new Pull Requests(for now, more to come soon).&lt;br&gt;
The functions causing the main slowdown i.e. &lt;em&gt;check_lightcurve, counts_err, cross_two_gtis, sort_counts, join, fourier_cross, rebin_data, rms_error, gti_border_bins, check_gtis, operation_with_other_lc and p_multitrial_from_single_trial &lt;/em&gt;were identified. These were further analyzed line-wise for deeper insights(also included in the document).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q3I5H5d6R8BEj73q7-YuAA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These look beautiful in the picture but analyzing 535 of these is super tedious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;airspeed velocity is a powerful tool that helps track the performance of a project over time, commit after commit. It is essentially a set of tests that can be run after every commit/change to check if the performance has been altered. It is used by numpy, scipy and astropy. The documentation is very well written(&lt;em&gt;sighs with relief&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;br&gt;
Thus, integrating airspeed velocity was &lt;em&gt;comparatively &lt;/em&gt;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A brief personal submission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The thing I enjoy the most about GSoC is that just like most of you reading this article, I didn’t know, rather hadn’t even heard the names of all the tools I used and am probably adept at right now. &lt;br&gt;
I start working every day not knowing how to solve the task(often daunting) in front of me or what the day holds. But at the end of the day, I’m confident that I’ve learnt something new. &lt;br&gt;
This excites me and I look forward to every new day working on my GSoC project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out my repository for airspeed velocity below. There is a link on the right side that leads to a webpage which looks relatively empty at the moment, someday hopefully, it will look like &lt;a href="https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/"&gt;numpy’s asv&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/theand9/stingray-benchmarks"&gt;theand9/stingray-benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I would again like to apologize as this blog is going to be astronomically jargon-heavy(pun intended). &lt;br&gt;
Now before you decide to just watch the funny Joey video and go watch more Friends episodes; trust me after reading this 7 minute blog you will gain serious bragging rights. After which you can binge Friends to your heart’s content(I already got my popcorn bowl with me 😉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Bonding Phase and APE — 17&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/925/1*r3LeWqbDsz2bz-NfL3zadA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Community is about doing something that makes belonging matter”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary is the “people living in one particular area or people who are considered as a unit because of their common interests, social group, or nationality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin to the communities in the real world, the Open-Source Software community is one of the most diverse and active communities in the world. All Open-Source projects from the Linux Kernel to a niche, newly conceptualized project have several contributors keeping the project alive. &lt;br&gt;
The best part about this online community is that any individual willing to contribute to the project is welcomed irrespective of their caste, creed, gender, race, nationality, level of expertise. &lt;br&gt;
To be a part of a community of zealous, like-minded individuals working towards making the world a better place with software, makes you feel somewhat like a superhero😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of Open-Source is the power of the people &lt;/strong&gt;~ Philippe Kahn&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community bonding phase is probably the most important part of the whole program. A month is given to students to get acquainted with the project community and mentors. Students are expected to get familiarized with the &lt;em&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/em&gt; and other guidelines such as Contributing, Coding, Testing guidelines.&lt;br&gt;
This is an amazing opportunity to not only plan and research more about one’s project but also interact with other students of the same/different organization’s and learn more about their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rzgbbfXrjVV2jcr08x8MUg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;First Contact. The most exhilarating~2700 seconds of my life&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had two calls with my mentor Mr Matteo Bachetti during the community bonding phase. Lucky me, I got a one-to-one introduction to X-Ray Astronomy(with an amazing presentation) from Mr Bachetti himself!!&lt;br&gt;
We discussed the goals, specifics as well as a rough trajectory of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community bonding phase gave me an amazing opportunity to not only associate with my peers from OpenAstronomy but also other organizations. I was particularly interested in a few projects from CERN-HSF as well as other projects from various sub-organizations in OpenAstronomy. &lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much, Siddharth Lal, Biswarup Banerjee, Raahul Singh, Kris Stern, Abhijeet Manhas and Sahil Yadav, Honey Gupta, Prateek Kumar Agnihotri and Pranath Reddy for answering my persistent and often novice-level questions. You guys are awesome!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the community bonding phase, I started working on updating stingray to APE-17(view my PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/469"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It was my first major PR(For all the non-techies out there a Pull Request(PR) is a proposal to implement changes to the main codebase to squash a bug or add a new feature). Looking at the status of the PR changed to “&lt;strong&gt;merged&lt;/strong&gt;” gave me an unprecedented level of gratification. &lt;em&gt;#justprogrammerthings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I will not bore you with the technical aspects of APE-17 but if you wish to learn more about it, here’s a &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/files/4718995/APE17.Update.pdf"&gt;summarized document I created&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;X-ray Astronomy 101 with stingray&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/879/1*EsYpWW63Ui-bHMtjnIHjtQ.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/strong&gt;I am not an expert at X-ray Astronomy, not even by a long shot(Just a month’s experience). I am a Computer Science techie, passionate about space and great at googling stuff 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the part that all of you have been waiting for, the part that will give you the ultimate bragging rights of learning something new, &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt; in these lazy lockdown times, presenting to you&lt;em&gt;(insert drum roll) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;X-ray Astronomy 101 with stingray.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is stingray? What does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stingray is a community-developed spectral-timing software package in Python for astrophysical data. It provides a basis for advanced spectral-timing analysis with a correct statistical framework while also being open-source.&lt;br&gt;
Stingray provides functionalities such as:&lt;br&gt;
a. Constructing light curves from event data and performing various operations on light curves (e.g. add, subtract, join, truncate)&lt;br&gt;
b. Good Time Interval operations&lt;br&gt;
c. Creating periodograms(power spectra) and cross spectra&lt;br&gt;
and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. So well what does all of this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the abrupt deep dive into the realm of long and daunting words that make zero sense at the moment. But please bear with me for a moment, once we are done with the basic you will truly appreciate the role that stingray plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/1*c_HQHP_uPGD4z6o11j7veg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A time series is a simple graph that can be plotted for any values eg. temperature, rainfall, stock price etc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Time Series:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a sequence of observations recorded at a succession of time intervals. In general, time series are characterized by the interdependence of its values. This means that the value of the series at some time &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt; is generally not independent of its value at, say, &lt;strong&gt;t−1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.&lt;strong&gt; Time Series Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a statistical technique that deals with gaining insights from periodic or stochastic(a fancy way of saying random, aperiodic) time-series data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s learn some astronomical terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*yMWqnSRF06lxoYKptQ4d-A.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;FFT I am looking at you&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Timing Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Many time series show periodic behaviour. This periodic behaviour can be very complex. Spectral analysis is a technique that allows us to discover underlying periodicities by decomposing the complex signal into simpler parts. To perform spectral analysis, we first must transform data from the time domain to the frequency domain. &lt;br&gt;
Hence spectral analysis can be defined as decomposing a stationary time series {&lt;em&gt;xT}&lt;/em&gt; into a combination of sinusoids(sine waves), with a random (and uncorrelated) coefficient; essentially analysis in the frequency domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Good Time Intervals (GTI’s)&lt;/strong&gt;: When observing a stellar object with a satellite, data is accumulated by observing the source with short exposures over time or collecting single photons(light particles) with their arrival time.&lt;br&gt;
While recording observations, there will be times when everything is working perfectly. At other times we might have obstructions from the Earth that hinder our ability to observe the source properly.&lt;br&gt;
Good time intervals (GTIs) are the time intervals where instruments are working well and the source is perfectly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Light Curves&lt;/strong&gt;: Light curves are graphs that show the brightness of an object over a period of time. Images show from the part of an object from where light is emitted. Another piece of information we have about light is the time when it reaches the detector. Astronomers use this “timing” information to create light curves and perform timing analysis. &lt;br&gt;
They are simply graphs of brightness (Y-axis) vs. time (X-axis). Brightness increases as you go up the graph and time advances as you move to the right.&lt;br&gt;
eg. The following lightcurve can be generated with the values from the table on the left. The change in brightness is periodic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*FNFYTegivTDTnsfqis1Tag.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can generate similar light curves for studying any part of the light spectrum eg. X-Rays. The record of changes in brightness that a light curve provides can help astronomers understand processes at work within the object they are studying and identify specific categories of stellar events.&lt;/p&gt;

When these signals are viewed in the form of a frequency spectrum, certain aspects of the received signals or the underlying processes producing them are revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.&lt;strong&gt; Power Spectral Density Function&lt;/strong&gt;: A Power spectral density function (PSD) shows the number of energy variations as a function of frequency. In other words, it shows at which frequencies are variations strong, weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/0*ZYcuX1JdLSPTjPeM.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;f. &lt;strong&gt;Cross Spectra&lt;/strong&gt;: Cross spectral analysis allows one to determine the relationship between two time-series as a function of frequency. Normally, we wish to compare two time-series along their peaks to see if these signals are related to one another at the same frequency and if so, what is the phase relationship between them. Even if two signals look identical we wish to check their periodicity and understand how they are related.&lt;br&gt;
The Cross spectrum is a frequency domain analysis of the cross-correlation (how two lightcurves are related) or cross-covariance(how two lightcurves are related if one of them is linearly transformed eg. shifted in time).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. How does stingray contribute to all of this confusing stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stingray implements all of these complex functions in a single easy to use package. It has various methods and classes such as lightcurve, powerspectrum, crossspectrum.&lt;br&gt;
Stingray also provides a &lt;em&gt;HENDRICS &lt;/em&gt;CLI and &lt;em&gt;dave &lt;/em&gt;GUI interface for abstract analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woohoo!!🎉🎉 you made it through.&lt;br&gt;
Now if all of this intrigues you as much as it did me, you can go through the references mentioned below and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks"&gt;stingray notebooks &lt;/a&gt;that demonstrate the functionality mentioned above or even fork the repository and tinker around with the code yourself(&lt;strong&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
