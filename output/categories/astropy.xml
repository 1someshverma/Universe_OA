I will be virtually meeting Aarya and Moritz again Tom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the past few weeks now, I have been pushing commits to a Draft PR¬†&lt;a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835"&gt;https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835&lt;/a&gt;¬†on GitHub. I wanted to have something working quite early in the project, in order to be able to pinpoint accurately when something doesn't work. This is why I started with directly adding the &lt;b&gt;cdspyreadme&lt;/b&gt; code within Astropy. Afterwards, I am also writing the code from scratch. As more of the required features from &lt;b&gt;cdspyreadme&lt;/b&gt; get integrated into &lt;i&gt;cds.py&lt;/i&gt;, those files and codes added earlier will be removed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the reading/writing to Machine Readable Table format, in fact I wrote about it briefly in my GSoC Proposal that I could attempt it as an extension. I don't have an opinion on whether or not it should have it's own format classes etc. However, since the title of my GSoC project is to &lt;b&gt;Add a CDS format writer to Astropy&lt;/b&gt;, I would prefer to work on the CDS format writer first and then on the MRT format. The MRT header anyway appears to be a bit simpler than the CDS header, so there shouldn't be much difficulty in the extension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in a nutshell, this is my workflow:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try out directly using &lt;b&gt;cdspyreadme&lt;/b&gt; from within Astropy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add CdsData.write method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a ByteByByte writer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write features to add complete ReadMe to the Header, starting off with having both ReadMe and Data in a single file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have features for writing separate CDS ReadMe and Data file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further work on some specific table columns, for instance, those containing Units and Coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add appropriate tests along the way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resolve other issues that come up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MRT format reader/writer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have completed the first three tasks and will now work on the fourth. I think by the time this finishes, a separate &lt;i&gt;CDSColumn.py&lt;/i&gt; won't be required. I can open another PR which adds the Data writer, in the meantime.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's see how it goes!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Astropy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210622_2223_suyog7130/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 21:23:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>astropy@GSoC Blog Post #2, Week 1&amp;2</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210619_2154_suyog7130/</link><dc:creator>Suyog Garg</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's been two weeks of astropy@GSoC work already. Of course I have been damn busy! With the last commit made to the draft PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835"&gt;https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/11835&lt;/a&gt;, a few hours back, I have successfully written a basic CDS writer. And voil√† it works, albeit without the ReadMe at present! üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am quite unlikely to go into technical details here in these posts. There are two reasons for this. Hhm..., Na I guess there's just one single reason. It would be too repetitive a task to write them. I already write aplenty about those in the GitHub comments and other communications. And of course, the whole codes I am writing during the project are available publicly on GitHub, for the overly curious kind. Moreover, the final report is gonna have more than ample discussion too, because I like to explain myself a lot. üòê What then is the need to write all that here again? So consider these posts my plain uncouth thoughts, which in any case, I suppose, aligns more with the spirit OpenAstronomy asks these for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a second important point, honestly, these Astropy people are really intelligent. It would appear, even more as the project progresses, that they knowingly marked a normal project as &lt;i&gt;Easy&lt;/i&gt;¬†to lure some innocent students! üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See ya the next time! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the course of the next 10 weeks or so, I will be working on the Astropy project under the umbrella organisation OpenAstronomy. During this while, I aim to add a CDS format writer to the Astropy library with the help of my affable mentors Aarya and Moritz.¬† ¬†&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had actually also applied for GSoC last summer, however I had failed to pass   one of the eligibility criteria, and so wasn't selected. This astropy@GSoC   project, therefore, is quite an awesome opportunity for me. I am looking   forward to making the most of it and enjoying the time all the same. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are two preliminary observations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  ¬† ¬† 1. The associated stipend, albeit somewhat lower than what used   to be the case a few years back, is freaking awesome. üòâ &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  ¬† ¬† 2. Dunno, why this project is marked as Difficultly Low!?   Nothing as easy as being just the third person to write a Table writer for the   world's largest Astronomy code library! üòÇüòé &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alright. Bye.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See ya the next time! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  Stay tuned for more GSoC updates, or what is far better, for the next post in   general. &lt;/div&gt;
