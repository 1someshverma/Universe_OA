It‚Äôs the completion of 1st week and in this post, I will tell you what I have done in this week and what I have planned to do in the coming weeks. As per my timeline in the proposal, I should be removing all the compiler warnings in the first week.

RA / DEC
RA (right ascension) and DEC (declination) are the longitudes and latitudes of the sky. RA corresponds to east/west direction (like longitude), while Dec measures north/south dire &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://adl1995.github.io/an-introduction-to-coordinate-systems-used-in-astronomy.html"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Astropy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/05/20170523_0737_adl1995/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 06:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
