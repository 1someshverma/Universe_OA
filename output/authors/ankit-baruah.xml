I am sure there must be something that is broken, which I have not yet discovered that’s my fear. So writing unit tests &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@ankit_b/during-the-1st-evaluation-42485dd9b7b4?source=rss-fc0a4b737255------2"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170627_1812_abit2/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 17:12:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>So close to first evaluation</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170620_1645_abit2/</link><dc:creator>Ankit Baruah</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Had quite a few PR’s to be made and issues that had to be discussed in this two weeks. The archives of IRIS don’t seem to account the rotation of the sun when saving the WCS data. So we are at a crossroad whether to compromise on speed or go along without bothering for now and give a 2.0 release lat &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@ankit_b/so-close-to-the-first-evaluation-612e9b53a8a7?source=rss-fc0a4b737255------2"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170620_1645_abit2/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 15:45:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>1st week of coding period…</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2017/06/20170606_1708_abit2/</link><dc:creator>Ankit Baruah</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of the 1st week everything seemed uncertain.

I tried getting into the program last year (2016). I started contributing in late February, it was overwhelming for me at that time. So, I gave up.
