Although, outer space looks all fancy and it goes well with the theme of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From all my previous posts, it is quite evident that I obsess over small and insignificant details, mainly directed towards how my life is going to be in the future and this entire concept of “happiness”. However, the past few months of working with Sunpy has brought about this odd sense of calm. The entire feeling of stress being an emotion goes out the window. Maybe this is what doing something you love, maybe it’s the people — or maybe it’s just extremely good timing combined with coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I suppose these questions don’t have simple answers. Regardless, whatever I’m doing with right now has restored that balance that I was longing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to what has been happening with sunkit-pyvista. To summarize, I spent an entire week fixing things that I caused due to over-confidence :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I think I’m nearing the end of this project. A few bits of functionality has to be added in but for the most part, I think it’s all in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saving and loading entire scenes are now possible with the work that we’ve done. This took quite a bit of time and it was pretty interesting to see how we could extend functionality to such massive extents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We uncovered a few hidden issues that may have occurred because of me. Ones such as ill-defined tests because I may have been slightly over-confident with how I write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a bit of time was spent resolving these issues, but I can definitely conclude that it was well worth the effort and I certainly learnt my lesson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure tests are now a thing, we drew some parallels with Pyvista’s code and structured our own figure testing methodology which makes it easier for us to visually identify any mishaps in our plots. After all, we’re creating a library for data visualization. It’d be sad if our code tests pass and we’re under the assumption that everything is working fine (yet another dig at myself for not writing efficient tests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can safely say that Sunkit-Pyvista is quite balanced and usable now, or at least I hope so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to how this might be the last few PRs of this project under the whole “GSoC timeline”, this makes me both sad and happy. It’s saddening to see that something I worked towards for over 6 months has kind of come to an end. Happy because I’ve gotten to work with some of the best developers and I genuinely enjoyed every bit of it. This offsets the balance in my life, but I think we may have a solution to this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve personally faced no a few issues with getting things to work as they are. I don’t have much to say about this project except the fact that I’m super stoked about it and it has been going super well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to write code from scratch that’s turned into an actual project that would help someone, I also get to learn stuff that I never saw myself doing. From tinkering around with CircleCI to getting documentation to work the way we want them to, this project seems like the ideal one for a python developer like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize what happened over the past few weeks —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve gotten over most of the project and we’re now working towards the initial stuff we put a pin in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic plotting functionality of Sunpy now exists with Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We moved the documentation over to GitHub workflows and I’m hoping that we get it to work by the end of the month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve introduced animations as a new feature to our work and we’ve got some ideas with how to take this forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having no prior experience with Astrophysics, I decided to give Stephen Hawking’s “The Theory of Everything” a read. (Well, not a read, I prefer listening to audio books even though they are inferior). Revisiting physics with an astronomical sense gave me such a new perspective on what I am doing and fueled the motivation to continue the project with the same excitement I began with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zrsJJIzLw4FexpUa1-SAUw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regardless of it not actually looking like this — it still is fascinating, isn’t it?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I never saw myself voluntarily taking an interest in astrophysics or open source software, but here I am today, doing both of them simultaneously. Who knows what the future holds for me, I’ve always been anxious about that. At times like these I try to think of how this universe is so nondeterministic, we may have a few guesses and theories as to why things happen the way it does but, we can’t say for sure. This thought grounds my thoughts and I suddenly stop worrying about everything, for sometime at-least…&lt;/p&gt;

From where we started of with Sunkit-Pyvista, to where we are today makes me feel a tad bit happy! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/985/1*-X2tw67TTrMoj3F43QS0uA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks 1 and 2 were initially set out for me to complete adding rotation functionality to the library, which started off great, but ended up causing some confusion 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was quickly sorted out and we went with not having to implement rotation functionality and moved on, learning that not everything will go according to plan and it’s okay for stuff to not work out at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the work that I had set out to do was completed well and it was all smooth sailing from then on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We worked on implementing the setting of the initial camera position from Astropy’s Skycoord.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few 2D methods were converted to it’s 3D counter part to be used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit tests for the implemented methods were added as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/225/0*alo7nZjT7uTO6BzJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mid-level solar flare, observed on Jan. 12, 2015.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m don’t know the first thing when it comes to astrophysics or astronomy, I do know that there is some pretty cool stuff going on out there though! I may not know what that is, but there’s a small sense of satisfaction in knowing that maybe whatever I’m doing is going to help someone out there do their work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=1c9683c38461" width="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210622_0048_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 23:48:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Summer with SunPy ☀️</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210603_0834_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was introduced to the world of open source by a few peers of mine and despite having the many unanswered questions about why open source software exists, eventually I decided to try my hand at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I had mentioned how I’d continue to be a contributor to SunPy regardless of the outcome of GSOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I made a promise to myself that regardless of the outcome of my proposal, I will continue to contribute to this organization that taught me so much.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, this showed up a couple of weeks later :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*WnrYxkGo8nkbdKoDz-xCAA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out things went my way and this gave me the motivation I was lacking for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my project is quite simple actually. &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt; allows for visualization of spatially-aware data by means of Map objects. These objects have extensive 2D visualization capabilities for plotting various coordinate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibility will be experimenting and tinkering around with these visualization capabilities and converting them into 3D with some extra added functionality! Seems pretty cool right? Well, it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’d be doing :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/191/1*QlX4LmZXc7e_C96fL-qHRA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Converting this&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/917/1*Omv0aIRFxR7VR9F6ruIBaQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To this!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project involves using &lt;strong&gt;Pyvista&lt;/strong&gt;, a python api for using the Visualization Toolkit. The entire project is part of a separate package affiliated with SunPy and you can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first 2 weeks with SunPy went great! It involved learning and tinkering around with &lt;strong&gt;Sphinx &lt;/strong&gt;for documentation which I had never used before, figuring out what goes where and how it happens was pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve finally decided on how we’d go about producing unit tests for these plots, we uncovered an issue with &lt;strong&gt;PyVista &lt;/strong&gt;as well. The project mentors and I had a few discussions on how to render these 3D plots for display in our documentation, how this would impact the continuous integration builds as our current one seemed to be having a few issues with &lt;strong&gt;XVFB&lt;/strong&gt; server and displaying the plots correctly. These issues are yet to be fixed and a concrete solution is to be decided on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few pull requests with the initial code to set up the package and provide basic plotting functionality was merged in and the package finally produces a 3D plot for any map in &lt;strong&gt;Sunpy&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked the end of the community bonding phase of the project and in the coming weeks, I’ll be working on experimenting with rotation and &lt;strong&gt;AstroPy’s SkyCoord&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll also be working on some plotting field lines from &lt;strong&gt;PfssPy&lt;/strong&gt; which would add some extra functionality to the library. I’ve finally gotten into getting my hands dirty with the code and I’m loving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much it for the first fortnight with &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;, looking forward to see how this project turns out, everything seems to be going well and I’m grateful to be working on this project with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
